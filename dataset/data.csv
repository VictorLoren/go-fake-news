                                <p><em>DC Toy Collector</em> is the &#x201C;highest paid performer&#x201D; on YouTube <a href=""http://www.people.com/article/dc-toy-collector-mystery-youtube-highest-paid-account"">making nearly $5 million last year unboxing Disney toys</a>. However, little has been known about the woman-behind-the-hands of the popular YouTube channel. In fact, her face is never shown in the video, only her voice, toys and hands. However, a recent report reveals the true identity of the <a href=""http://www.inquisitr.com/1658452/zoe-sugg-youtube-sensation-zoella-smashes-records-with-first-novel-girl-online/"">YouTube hit</a> and the identity is somewhat shocking. A former Brazilian porn star is behind the wholesome Disney videos and it is noted that during the early years of &#x201C;Disney Collector,&#x201D; the woman was filming both Disney unboxing videos and porn in the same Florida home.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2958242/Brazilian-former-porn-star-Diane-DeJesus-mystery-figure-5million-year-YouTube-sensation-DC-Toys-Collector.html""><em>The Daily Mail</em></a> reports that Brazilian Daiane DeJeus, also known as Sandy Summers in the porn industry, is the woman behind the hit Disney Collector Youtube videos. Reporters tracked down information on DeJeus that aligns with public records information regarding the widely popular <em>DC Toy Collector</em> YouTube channel. After tracking down DeJeus, the reporters spoke with family and friends who confirmed that Daiane was behind the million dollar videos.</p>
<p>DeJeus has went to unfathomable measures to ensure her identity remained secret and for good reason. The target market of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/DisneyCollectorBR/videos?flow=grid&amp;view=0&amp;sort=da"">the YouTube channel</a>, which caters to Disney lovers such as children and families, may not remain viewers if they knew the owner&#x2019;s secret. DeJeus was not only a Disney fanatic, but also a porn star. Going by the name Sandy Summers, Dejeus filmed numerous x-rated videos for the adult film industry in the same home that she filmed some of her <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/DisneyCollectorBR/videos?flow=grid&amp;view=0&amp;sort=da"">early <em>DC Toy Collector</em> features</a>.</p>
<p>Family and friends have identified DeJeus as the mystery unboxer and note that certain physical features on the woman&#x2019;s hands and arms can be seen in many of the YouTube videos.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#x201C;They pointed to a tell-tale scar on her left elbow and a mole just above her elbow joint as being identical to those that can be seen on Summers in many of her lingerie photo shoots.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
<p>Aside from the physical similarities, former neighbors say DeJeus has an unmistakable voice and say that many people on the street knew what she was up to.</p>
<blockquote class=""pullquote""><p>&#x2018;That is Daiane. She has a very childlike voice and I would recognize it anywhere. Most people in the street eventually knew what she was up to.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
<p>Would you have ever imagined that the popular <em>DC Toy Collector</em> videos were being filmed in the same house as adult films by a porn star?</p>

According to the pair, Casey Dean, then 14, and 13-year-old Eduard Nitz stopped off at their local restaurant in the mid-90s to pick up some burgers.</p><p>
In the order was a Quarter Pounder with cheese they had bought for a friend.</p> <p>
He never turned up, instead asking the pair to keep it safe for when he was in the city next.</p><p>
Now 20 years later, it remains under lock and key and bears an uncanny resemblance to its far fresher contemporaries.</p><p>
&quot;We&apos;re pretty sure it&apos;s the oldest burger in the world,&quot; Mr Dean said.</p><p>
&quot;It started off as a joke, you know we told our friend we&apos;d hold his burger for him but he never turned up and before we knew it six months had passed.</p><p>
&quot;The months became years and now, 20 years later, it looks the same as it did the day we bought it, perfectly preserved in its original wrapping.&quot;</p><p>
The pair showed off the mould-free specimen on <a href=""http://tenplay.com.au/channel-ten/the-project""><em>The Project</em></a> tonight, teasing that they might take a bite after all these years in the name of charity.</p><p>
But common sense prevailed when the show&#x2019;s hosts protested, and they left the decades-old meal for another day.</p><p>The burger&apos;s Facebook page,&#xA0;<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Can-This-20-Year-Old-Burger-Get-More-Likes-Than-Kanye-West/1393460647629934?fref=nf"">Can This 20 Year Old Burger Get More Likes Than Kanye West?</a>, has attracted 3000 likes in one week.</p><p>The duo also selling a&#xA0;<em>Free the Burger&#xA0;</em>song on iTunes for $1.69, with proceeds going to <a href=""http://www.beyondblue.org.au/"">Beyond Blue</a>.</p> <p class=""article-body__attribution nine digital pty ltd"">&#xA9; Nine Digital Pty Ltd 2017</p> <ul class=""article-tags""> <li class=""article-tags__tag article-tags__tag--important""><a href=""http://www.9news.com.au/entertainment"">Entertainment</a></li> <li class=""article-tags__tag""><a href=""http://www.9news.com.au/south-australia"">South Australia</a></li> <li class=""article-tags__tag""><a href=""http://www.9news.com.au/food"">food</a></li> <li class=""article-tags__tag""><a href=""http://www.9news.com.au/buzz"">Buzz</a></li> </ul> <div class=""article-tips cf""> <small>You can remain anonymous. <a href=""http://www.9news.com.au/contact-us""><strong>Click here</strong></a> for more information.</small> </div> </div></div>",www.9news.com.au,,290

(NBC)</p> </div> <p>It&#x2019;s a common practice around the world to speed up TV shows in order to insert more commercial time. The subtle speeding up can slice a couple of minutes from a 22 minute sitcom with little noticeable difference&#x2013;and broadcasters can plug in two more minutes of commercials per half hour! It&#x2019;s a last ditch effort, perhaps, to extract money out of a dying media delivery system before streaming obliterates the advertising model. TBS does it with Seinfeld reruns (see below) and worldwide it happens all the time&#x2013;from the BBC to India.</p>
<p>But is that all there is to it&#x2013;trying to make more money? Actually many viewers&#xA0;point out that TV shows (and everything else) move faster now in the age of the 6-second Vine. The speeding up actually helps the content itself seem more contemporary. Here&#x2019;s one commenter: &#x201C;Honestly, shows move a lot faster now and the sped up version feels a little more updated than the original slower version. But who even watches actual TV anymore? No TV + adblock on 90% of internet = very little advertising = happy me :)&#x201D;</p>

<p>Networks will do anything to squeeze in more commercials.&#xA0; They&#x2019;ve started new episodes during the credits of the previous episode.&#xA0; They&#x2019;ve plastered ads at the bottom of the screen in the middle of the episode.&#xA0; Now they&#x2019;re playing dirty by speeding through the episodes just to get in a few more minutes of precious ad time.</p>
<p>An intrepid <b><i>Seinfeld</i></b> fan [via <a href=""http://reddit.com/"">reddit</a>] noticed that everyone&#x2019;s favorite show about nothing seemed to be running slightly faster.&#xA0; To check, he compared the airing of a recent episode to a digital recording of the same episode from ten years ago on the same hardware.&#xA0; He found that the show was running 7.5% faster, which amounts to freeing up two minutes of ad time.</p>

You can picture some stuffed suit in middle-management watching the same Seinfeld episode sped up to various percentages&#x2014;3.5, 10, 12.5&#x2014;to see how the jokes land. They probably focus-tested specific jokes in midwestern malls in order to find the razor&apos;s edge of comedy,<strong> the exact line before Jerry Seinfeld turns into Alvin and the Chipmunks</strong> and the timing of all the jokes is ruined. Quantifiably it&apos;s the same show, but in reality it&apos;s stretched to just before the breaking point, analyzed and efficiency-tested in order to cram more salable real estate into a lot that refuses to change size. The life is being sucked out of it, one decimal point at a time.</p> </div>",www.thestranger.com,,312

<p>Reruns of Seinfeld, Friends, and other shows are getting the rapid playback treatment on top pay-TV networks like TNT and TBS, and most people are none the wiser. And even movie classics are being sped up, as one expert on The Wizard of Oz noticed during a recent airing on TBS.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Their voices were raised a notch,&#x201D; he tells the Journal about the already high-pitched Munchkin characters in the 1939 film.</p>
<p>Some cable channels have gotten so edit- and compression-happy that they can now fit in more than 20 minutes of ads each hour, several minutes more than what you&#x2019;ll find on most prime-time network broadcasts.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It is a way to keep the revenue from going down as much as the ratings,&#x201D; one pay-TV exec explains to the Journal. &#x201C;The only way we can do it is to double down and stretch the unit load a little more.&#x201D;</p>
<p>While you might assume that TV advertisers would be happy with more opportunities for running their commercials, not everyone in the ad business is thrilled about all this cramming.</p>
<p>&#x201C;They are trying to deal with a problem in a way that is making the problem bigger,&#x201D; says the president of national broadcast at media buyer Omnicom Media Group.</p>
<p>And the content producers who supply these shows and movies the cable channels are also concerned about the way things are heading.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It has gotten completely out of control,&#x201D; the head of distribution for one major TV studio tells the Journal. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m concerned when you look at the performance being diminished and hurt by their running the shows that way.&#x201D;</p>
<p>This YouTube clip from 2013 shows the speed difference between an original copy of a Seinfeld episode and a TBS rerun. According to the person who posted it, the increase in playback speed would allow for two additional minutes of commercials in a single half-hour episode:</p>

But the networks&apos; solution to fixing a revenue shortfall could have an unintended consequence: By packing in even more ads, their remaining viewers could get fed up with the clutter and ditch cable in favor of video services that cut out the ads, such as Netflix (<a href=""http://markets.cbsnews.com/NFLX/quote/"">NFLX</a>) and Amazon (<a href=""http://markets.cbsnews.com/AMZN/quote/"">AMZN</a>) Prime. </p><p>The networks that are using compression technology to speed up their shows include Time Warner&apos;s (<a href=""http://markets.cbsnews.com/TWX/quote/"">TWX</a>) TBS, which sped up &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; last November and used the technology on repeats of &quot;Seinfeld,&quot; according to the Journal (To see a comparison of two &quot;Seinfeld&quot; clips, one normal speed and the other at the faster rate, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjQ7xCJMVf0#t=169"">click here</a>.) Viacom&apos;s (<a href=""http://markets.cbsnews.com/VIA/quote/"">VIA</a>) TV Land has also used the same strategy with &quot;Friends&quot; repeats.</p><p>Cable networks are also using strategies such as cutting down opening credits to make more time for ads. </p><p>The sped-up TV shows are emerging as cable-advertising sales encountered headwinds last year, thanks to lower ratings. With cable networks trying to squeeze more money out of every hour, that&apos;s caused a sharp ramp-up in commercial minutes. </p><p>Five years ago, the average commercial time on cable TV was 14.5 minutes, but that reached 15.8 minutes last year, according to data from Nielsen cited by The Journal. </p><p>Viewers are also seeing more ads because cable networks are selling more shorter spots, with a <a href=""http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-nielsen-advertising-study-20140510-story.html"">surge in the number of 15-second commercials</a> at the expense of 30-second ads. That switch in the mix of ad lengths and longer commercial breaks overall means that cable networks are reaping more in advertising revenue, even though the cost of a 30-second spot in primetime declined from 2009 to 2013. </p><p>Although the new strategies might bolster cable networks&apos; revenue in the short term, they risk alienating viewers over the long-term. It may be no coincidence that such ad-stuffing strategies are emerging just as cord-cutting becomes a very real phenomenon. </p><p>Cable TV subscriptions rose at a compound average annual rate of 6.1 percent from 1995 to 2013, the <a href=""http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2014/db0516/DA-14-672A1.pdf%20"">Federal Communications Commission reported last year</a>. That&apos;s more than double the rate of inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index, which rose at a compound average annual rate of 2.4 percent during the same period. </p><p>What that boils down to is that consumers, many of whom are suffering from stagnant wages, are paying much more for cable service than ever before. At the same time, they are effectively being asked to sit through the indignities of sped-up dialogue and increasingly long ad breaks. </p><p>It&apos;s no wonder that &quot;cord-cutting&quot; is now a verb. With the pay TV industry shedding about <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/pay-tv-cord-cutting-accelerates-1415321442"">179,000 customers in the third quarter alone</a>, it&apos;s now become what should be a worrying trend for the cable networks and providers.</p></div>",www.cbsnews.com,,540

<p><div class=""quoteBlock"">
Why is the dialogue sped up for the Seinfeld episodes on demand? It is so annoying! It almost sounds like they cut out half the word after they begin saying it. This is hard to listen to.</div><br>
</p>
<p><font class=""copyright_text_color_g""><b>Origins:</b></font> &#xA0; It&#x2019;s an immutable fact of television life that local stations and cable networks typically run more commercials during the airing of syndicated series than broadcast networks airing first-run episodes of current series do, which requires the former to find ways to fit 30- or 60-minutes episodes into a shorter amount of air time. As well, the amount of air time given over to commercials (by both networks and cable channels) has <a href=""http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-nielsen-advertising-study-20140510-story.html"">grown</a> in recent years, making it even more difficult to squeeze full episodes of syndicated series around commercial breaks:</p>
<p><div class=""quoteBlock""><br>
The number of commercials in the typical hour of television has grown steadily during the last five years, according to a new study from the ratings measurement firm Nielsen.</div></p>
<p>The rise in commercials can be attributed to two factors: Broadcast and cable networks are allotting more time for commercials, and advertisers are increasingly using shorter spots to hawk their products.</p>
<p>In 2009, the broadcast networks averaged 13 minutes and 25 seconds of commercial time per hour. In 2013, that figure grew to 14 minutes and 15 seconds.<br>
</p></div><br> <p>This issue has usually been dealt with by judiciously cutting scenes from episodes when they air in syndication &#x2014; sometimes to the dismay of fans who have purchased DVDs of their favorite series, only to find those discs used the truncated syndicated versions of episodes rather than the original broadcast versions.</p>
<p>But there&#x2019;s another way for stations to fit the same amount of televised material into a shorter time slot, one which has left many viewers puzzled and annoyed. It was demonstrated in a video posted to the <nobr><a href=""http://www.avsforum.com/forum/34-hdtv-programming/1490528-tbs-speeds-up-seinfeld-full-7-5-percent-here-proof.html"">AVS Forum</a></nobr> on <nobr>13 September</nobr> 2013, that the TBS cable network was airing sped-up (or &#x201C;time compressed&#x201D;) versions of the popular half-hour sitcom <i>Seinfeld</i> in order to fit more commercials into its time slot:</p>
<p><div class=""quoteBlock""><br>
My computer has a tuner card. I used this tuner card to digitally record Seinfeld from Fox Chicago roughly 10 years ago (I archived the entire series). Then I found which episode was on TBS tonight. In the upper-right window is a live feed from the tuner card. The source is TBS&#x2019;s SD feed via Dish Network. The lower-right is video playback from the digital recording, also recorded from Dish Network in 2003. I fed the audio from both the live feed and the video clip as well as the video from the S-video out on my video card to an external DVD recorder, then uploaded the final result to youtube. After 202 seconds of playback, the TBS live feed had advanced a full 15 seconds over the recording. This amounts to nearly 2 minutes over the course of a full episode.</div></p>
<p>I lined up the windows as closely as possible so you can also see cropping. Between that and the extreme speed increase, TBS is butchering a classic.</p>

<p>When FXX took over the syndication rights of <a href=""http://uproxx.com/tag/the-simpsons""><em>The Simpsons</em></a> last year, one of the stipulations were older episodes with longer run-times were going to be edited to the modern standard of 22 minutes in order to fit in the now normal 8 minutes of advertising found within half-hour programming.</p>
<p>Not every network is so keen on trimming whole scenes to make run-times work for older shows, but that doesn&#x2019;t mean they&#x2019;re immune to tricks of their own. That&#x2019;s reportedly what&#x2019;s happening over at TBS.</p>
<p>Thanks to one crafty viewer, it seems to have been discovered that TBS has been running syndicated episodes of <a href=""http://uproxx.com/topic/seinfeld""><em>Seinfeld</em></a> 7.5&#xA0;percent&#xA0;faster than the show&#x2019;s standard speed in order to squeeze in as much advertising as possible into the airspace. Unfortunately, while it&#x2019;d be nice to say this news is shocking, it isn&#x2019;t. These shows were meant to air at a time when most sitcoms ran 25 minutes, and thus it&#x2019;s either this or a trim to <em>The Simpsons</em> in order to make them fit modern standards.</p>

<p>We may finally have an answer to one of the most pressing questions of the 1990s: Who played the sun baby on the show <i>The Teletubbies</i>? Jess Smith, a 19-year-old from Chatham, Kent, recently <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/11310883/The-baby-from-Teletubbies-reveals-herself.html"">claimed</a> she played the iconic children&#x2019;s character:</p>
<p><font class=""quote_font""><br>
<div class=""quote_style""><br>
So I&#x2019;ve recently celebrated my 19th birthday and after a lot of thought, I&#x2019;ve decided it&#x2019;s time to tell everyone. I used to hide it but after a lot of encouragement from my friends at university, I&#x2019;ve gained the confidence to come out with it.</div></font></p>
<p>I am the sun from <i>Teletubbies</i>. There has been quite a few people pretending to be &#x2018;the sun&#x2019; but only I could tell you the real story.<br>
</p></div>
<p>
According to Smith, a production company came to Edenbridge Hospital in 1996 looking for smiley babies. Since Jess fit the description, her mother, Anjela Smith, decided to introduce her to the world of television:</p>
<p><font class=""quote_font""><br>

It was just something a bit different to do and we didn&#x2019;t expect it to be as big as it was. They just sat her in front of a camera and she just laughed and smiled at her dad. We didn&#x2019;t hear anything until we got a letter when she was <nobr>18 months</nobr> old saying she&#x2019;d been picked. It was really weird seeing her on television.<br>

<p>Jess Smith&#x2019;s story has not been corroborated by the creators of <i>Teletubbies</i>, but the college student did present some documentary evidence that, if genuine, is pretty convincing: </p>

<p>Whenever I was sick (or fake-sick) in middle school and stayed home, I would watch a lot of <em>The Price Is Right</em>, <em>SportsCenter</em>, and whichever <em>Star Wars</em> movie was rewound to the beginning of the film on VHS. Occasionally, however, I&#x2019;d flip over to PBS and see how long I could stomach the adventures of Dipsy, Laa-Laa, Po, and the Gay One. This was during peak <em>Teletubbies</em> craze, when it was unavoidably popular (and weirdly controversial), and I wanted to see what the fuss was about. But as soon as the sun baby started giggling, I said NOPE to that and went back to yelling at idiots for overbidding on a washing machine that <em>clearly</em> cost less than $3,500. </p>
<p>At least now I know who to direct my sun rage at: <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2884843/Student-reveals-Teletubbies-giggling-baby-sky.html"">19-year-old Jess Smith</a>, a first-year college student at Canterbury Christ Church University who claims she played the monster in the sky (not God). She filmed the part when she was nine months old and didn&#x2019;t tell anyone outside of her family until &#x201C;a game with her university friends &#x2013; where they all had to say something about themselves that no one else would guess.&#x201D; Finally, a freshman orientation that isn&#x2019;t pointless.</p>
<blockquote><p>Miss Smith said: &#x201C;I thought I may as well tell them as I&#x2019;m going to be spending the next three years with them. My mother is really chuffed.&#x201D;</p>
<p>She then made the news public on Facebook.</p>
<p>She wrote: &#x201C;So I&#x2019;ve recently celebrated my 19th birthday and after a lot of thought, I&#x2019;ve decided it&#x2019;s time to tell everyone. I used to hide it but after a lot of encouragement from my friends at university, I&#x2019;ve gained the confidence to come out with it. I am the sun from <em>Teletubbies</em>.

<p>During filming, Smith was seated in a high chair, &#x201C;so she would be looking down like the sun,&#x201D; and her dad made her laugh by playing with a stuffed bear behind the camera.</p>
<blockquote><p>As no one could predict the success of the show, Jess was paid just &#xA3;250 for filming and given a box of toys to take home. (<a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2884843/Student-reveals-Teletubbies-giggling-baby-sky.html"">Via</a>)</p></blockquote>

<h3>Jess Smith: Why I Finally Decided To Come Clean</h3>
<p>Jess reportedly first revealed the truth during a &#x201C;getting-to-know-you game during her first week at Canterbury Christ Church University,&#x201D; <a href=""http://www.eonline.com/news/609065/meet-the-teletubbies-sun-baby-19-year-old-jess-smith-reveals-herself-as-the-smiling-face-who-looked-over-teletubbyland"">E! Online </a>claims. Soon thereafter, she told the rest of the world her secret via&#xA0;Facebook.</p> <a></a> <p>&#x201C;So I&#x2019;ve recently celebrated my 19th birthday and after a lot of thought, I&#x2019;ve decided it&#x2019;s time to tell everyone,&#x201D; she said on the social media site, according to E! Online.&#xA0;&#x201C;I used to hide it but after a lot of encouragement from my friends at university, I&#x2019;ve gained the confidence to come out with it.&#xA0;I am the sun from Teletubbies. There has been quite a few people pretending to be &#x2018;the sun&#x2019; but only I could tell you the real story.&#xA0;Everyone says they can see the likeness between my face now and me as a baby. I still have a baby face. I haven&#x2019;t changed much either. I am still giggly.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The resemblance is uncanny!</p>
<p>Ironically, there&#xA0;were rumors&#xA0;the true identity of the baby was a different&#xA0;<strong>Jessica Smith</strong>, the 27-year-old who starred on MTV&#x2019;s&#xA0;<em>Laguna Beach</em>, <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2884843/Student-reveals-Teletubbies-giggling-baby-sky.html"">Daily Mail</a> claims.

For one, actors will likely be paid more than the &#xA3;250 and box of toys Smith was paid back then.</p> <p>Smith&#x2019;s decision to break her silence was prompted by an assignment at Canterbury Christ Church University, when students were supposed to reveal something about themselves that no one else would guess.</p> <p>&#x201C;I thought I may as well tell them as I&#x2019;m going to be spending the next three years with them,&#x201D; Smith told <em><a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/11310883/The-baby-from-Teletubbies-reveals-herself.html"">The Telegraph</a></em>.</p> <p>So how did the show&#x2019;s producers get Smith to laugh for her signature shot? They didn&#x2019;t.

Others have rallied around Sony&apos;s predicament. </p> <p> George Clooney, in an interview with Deadline.com on Thursday, revealed that he had circulated a petition earlier in the week saying &quot;we fully support Sony&apos;s decision not to submit to these hackers&apos; demands&quot; -- but no one was willing to sign it. </p> <p> &quot;It was a large number of people. It was sent to basically the heads of every place,&quot; Clooney said without naming names. </p> <p> The petition said, &quot;This is not just an attack on Sony. It involves every studio, every network, every business and every individual in this country,&quot; and it concluded, &quot;We hope these hackers are brought to justice but until they are, we will not stand in fear. We will stand together.&quot; </p> <p> It&apos;s outdated now, since Sony did cancel &quot;The Interview.&quot; In the interview, Clooney expressed sadness that &quot;as we watched one group be completely vilified, nobody stood up.&quot; </p>   <div class=""storytimestamp""> <span class=""cnnStorySource""> CNNMoney (New York) </span> <span class=""cnnDateStamp"">First published December 19, 2014: 10:12 AM ET</span> </div> </div></div>",money.cnn.com,,641

<p><strong>&#x201C;This is a problem that&#x2019;s going to be with us for a very long time,&#x201D; </strong>Senator Dianne Feinstein has announced from the pulpit of CNN.<br></p>
<p>Feinstein, the chair of the Senate intelligence committee, said it is imperative that Congress pass legislation that would &#x201C;allow companies to share information with each other and the government &#x2026; and be protected from liability for doing so.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Pressed by Jake Tapper on the question of whether Sony made a mistake, she refused to assign blame, saying she thought that chairman Michael Lynton &#x201C;did practice all due diligence, he did call the White House, he recognizes there are contracts with big theater companies.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;This is a complicated matter &#x2026;if something were to happen, who is liable for a loss of life?&#x201D;</p>
<p>She instead returned to the responsibility of the federal government &#x201C;to respond appropriately, imminently.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;This can&#x2019;t continue to happen in my view. This is a problem that&#x2019;s going to be with us for a very long time. so we have to get certain strictures in place to get a handle on it.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I hope we can convince the North Koreans that this action has a very heavy price.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Finally, Feinstein urged US allies to write an international accord on cybersecurity, saying that the US has already been attacked by hackers in China, Russia, Iran and the states.</p>
<p>&#x201C;At some point if we face a disastrous attack, and this is what we must prevent, only an international agreement [can] solve it.&#x201D;</p>

<h2 class=""block-title"">Sony chairman: &apos;we made no mistake&apos;</h2>
<div class=""block-elements block-elements--no-byline"">
<p><strong>Sony made no mistake in pulling <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-interview"" class=""u-underline"">The Interview</a>, the company&#x2019;s chairman insists</strong>, despite President Obama&#x2019;s assertion that they did just that.<br></p>
<p>Michael Lynton told CNN&#x2019;s Fareed Zakaria that Sony &#x201C;experienced the worst cyberattack in American history and persevered under enormous stress for months.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Lynton tries to shift blame onto the theaters at &#x201C;the crucial moment that the threat came out, from what was called the GOP at the time&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The movie theaters came to us one by one over the course of a very short period of time, and announced that the would not carry the film. At that point we had no [choice] but to not proceed. And that&#x2019;s all.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The CEO even argued &#x201C;we have not backed down&#x201D; and said that Sony still has &#x201C;every desire to have the American public see this movie.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He said the company is considering &#x201C;a number of options&#x201D;, but that it requires an intermediary such as Netflix or a video-on-demand distributor. None, he said, have &#x201C;stepped forward and said they are willing.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;We don&#x2019;t have that direct interface with the American public.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Asked by Zakaria whether he&#x2019;d still make the film, Lynton tried to put on a brave face: &#x201C;I would make the movie again, for the same reasons we made it in the first place. It was a funny comedy, it served as political satire. Knowing what I know now we might&#x2019;ve done some things slightly differently, but I think a lot of events have overtaken us in a way we have no control of.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Obama ended with a reflection on the past year and his entire presidency:</p>
<p>&#x201C;One of the great things about this job is you get to meet American people of every race and every faith. And what I don&#x2019;t think is always captured in our political debates is that the vast majority of people are trying to do the right thing. And people are basically good and have good intentions. Sometimes our institutions don&#x2019;t work [as well]. Maybe police departments [do the wrong thing and] surface hidden biases.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He says videos like that of Eric Garner&#x2019;s death &#x201C;trouble everybody&#x201D;. </p>
<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve gone through difficult times. It is your job, press corps, to report on all the mistakes that are made and all the bad things that happen and crises that look like they&#x2019;re popping, and I understand that.</p>
<p>&#x201C;But through persistent effort and faith in the American people, things get better.&#x201D; </p>
<p>Obama listed the economy, energy, education and other issues as having improved over the past six years.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Part of what I hope as we reflect on the new year is this should generate some confidence. When we work together we can&#x2019;t be stopped.</p>
<p><strong>&#x201C;And now I&#x2019;m going on vacation.&#x201D;</strong></p>

<p>One last question gets in, on the topic of race relations in the US.</p>
<p><strong>&#x201C;Black America in the aggregate is better off than when I came into office,&#x201D; </strong>Obama said.</p>
<p>He continued: &#x201C;This is a legacy of a troubled racial past, but that&#x2019;s not an excuse for black folks, and I think the overwhelming majority of black folks understand that&#x2019;s not an excuse.&#x201D;</p>
<p>People are working hard, &#x201C;hustling every day&#x201D;, Obama said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;They&#x2019;re starting behind oftentimes in the race. What&#x2019;s true for all Americans is we should be willing to provide people a hand up &#x2013; not a handout. Help them afford college, and if we can help them succeed that&#x2019;s going to be good for all of us.</p>
<p>&#x201C;A lot of what we&#x2019;re seeing is coloured by Ferguson, and what we&#x2019;ve seen in New York, and that is that there are specific instances at least where law enforcement doesn&#x2019;t feel as if it&#x2019;s being applied in a colorblind fashion.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The taskforce that I&#x2019;ve formed is supposed to respond back to me in 90 days &#x2013; not with a bunch of abstract musings about race relations but some really concrete practical things that law enforcement, and police departments, can begin using right now.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Obama also responded to a question about the broader press around police killings and existing divides between black and white Americans.</p>
<p><strong>&#x201C;I actually think it&#x2019;s been a healthy conversation. </strong><strong>This is not a new phenomenon. </strong><strong>You&#x2019;re not going to solve the problem if it&#x2019;s not being talked about.&#x201D;</strong></p>

<p>The Keystone XL pipeline comes up in what Obama says is the last question.</p>
<p>Obama: &#x201C;<strong>At issue in Keystone is not American oil. It is Canadian oil,</strong><strong> that is drawn out of tar sands.</strong> That oil, currently, is being shipped out, through rails and trucks, and it would save Canadian companies and the Canadian oil industry an enormous amount of money if they could simply pump it through the United States down to the Gulf.</p>
<p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s very little impact, nominal impact, on US gas prices, what the average consumer American cares about, by having this Canadian oil get through.</p>
<p>&#x201C;And sometimes the implication is that gas prices are going to go lower here in the States, but they&#x2019;re not. It&#x2019;s good for Canadian oil companies. But it&#x2019;s not going to be even a nominal benefit to American jobs.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He talks more about jobs.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Now the creation of the pipeline itself is probably going to create a couple of thousand jobs. There&#x2019;s probably a couple additional jobs that can be created in the refining process down at the Gulf.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Those aren&#x2019;t insignificant, he says, but next to the jobs created by work on roads and bridges they simply don&#x2019;t compare. He pitches infrastructure to Congress again.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We could probably create hundreds of thousands of jobs, or a million jobs, so if that&#x2019;s the argument there are lots of ways to create American jobs.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I want to make sure that if in fact this process goes forward, I want to make sure it&#x2019;s not adding to the problem of climate change, which I do consider a very serious issue. And it does increase the cost to the American people.&#x201D;</p>

<p>A reporter now asks what happens if Cuba&#x2019;s human rights abuses worsen.</p>
<p>&#x201C;That doesn&#x2019;t mean that over the next two years we can&#x2019;t anticipate and take certain actions that we may find deeply troubling, either inside of Cuba or with respect to their foreign policy. And that could put significant strains on the relationship,&#x201D; Obama replies.</p>
<p>&#x201C;But that&#x2019;s true of a lot of countries out there where we have an embassy.</p>
<p>&#x201C;And the whole point of normalizing relations gives us the greater opportunity to have an influence.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Obama says he would be surprised if the Castro regime &#x201C;moves to effectively undermine their own policy&#x201D;.</p>
<p><strong>&#x201C;There will be carrots and sticks that we can apply.&#x201D;</strong></p>
<p>Asked about whether Fidel came up in his conversation with President Raul Castro of Cuba, Obama says that the ex-president was mentioned only in passing. Obama says he took about 15 minutes to get his preliminary remarks out of the way, &#x201C;and the end of my remarks I apologised for taking such a long time.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;And he said, &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t worry about it Mr President, you still have a chance to break Fidel&#x2019;s record, he once spoke for seven hours straight.&#x2019; And then Raul gave his own preliminary remarks that lasted at least twice as long as mine, and that gave me the opportunity to say &#x2018;it runs in the family&#x2019;.&#x201D;</p>
<p><strong>About the embargo:</strong></p>
<p>&#x201C;We can&#x2019;t unilaterally bring down the embargo. But what I do think is going to happen is there&#x2019;s going to be a process where Congress digests it; there are bipartisan supporters [...] people will see the reactions that unfold. I think there&#x2019;s going to be a healthy debate in Congress.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;I share the concerns of dissidents there and human rights activists. This is still a regime that represses its people. As I said in the announcement I don&#x2019;t anticipiate overnight changes. But I know deep in my bones that if you do the same thing for 50 years and nothing&#x2019;s changed, you&#x2019;ve got to do something else.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Then he moves onto the long term strategy of the tectonic shift in US-Cuban relations.</p>
<p><strong>&#x201C;Suddenly Cuba is open to the world in ways it hasn&#x2019;t been</strong>. It&#x2019;s open to Americans. It&#x2019;s open to church groups visiting their fellow believers in ways they haven&#x2019;t before. It opens the prospect of telecommunications and the internet.</p>
<p>&#x201C;And over time that chips away at this hermetically sealed society, and I believe that offers the best prospect of greater freedom, greater self-determination of the Cuban people. I think it&#x2019;ll happen in fits and starts, but we&#x2019;ll have a better chance.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Change is going to come to Cuba, it has to. They&#x2019;ve been reliant for years, first on subsidies from the Soviet Union, then from Venezuela.&#x201D; It has to change, Obama says, though he doesn&#x2019;t know how quickly.</p>

						<p>Amazon boss Jeff Bezos is primed and ready for a fresh assault on the streaming-video space.</p>
<p>The e-commerce giant will roll out a new ad-supported streaming offering early next year that will be separate from its $99-a-year Prime membership, which includes a video service, sources said.</p>
<p>The ad-supported option &#x2014; part of an overhaul of its media offerings &#x2014; poses a serious challenge to streaming rivals such as Hulu and Netflix, analysts said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;If they do an ad-supported service, they will decouple it from Prime and that is a Netflix killer,&#x201D; Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said. &#x201C;It won&#x2019;t be $99 a year.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Pachter suggested Amazon would undercut Netflix&#x2019;s current monthly price of $7.99.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Who wouldn&#x2019;t switch if you were poor or you&#x2019;re a cord-cutter?&#x201D; he added.</p>
<p>Although it will be separate from Prime, the ad-supported service is ultimately a bid by Amazon to lure people to eventually pay up for Prime membership, said one ad source familiar with Amazon&#x2019;s plans.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The main point is to bring in more users that you can eventually up-sell to Prime, or to get to a broader audience that doesn&#x2019;t want to pay for Prime, in order to increase their video share,&#x201D; the source said.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal reported in March that Amazon was weighing such a move, but sources confirmed that it&#x2019;s a definite go.</p>
<p>Amazon is prepping a new attack at a time when its video service is gaining ground, sources said. Amazon doesn&#x2019;t disclose the number of Prime members, but RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney estimates it has 50 million global customers.</p>
<p>While Prime&#x2019;s big draw has been two-day shipping, about half of Prime subscribers use the video service that is included with it, or around 25 million, sources said. By comparison, Netflix has 33 million domestic subscribers.</p>
<p>A recent Sandvine study also shows that Amazon is making major strides &#x2014; but has a long way to go before catching Netflix. Amazon&#x2019;s broadband traffic on fixed networks grew from 1.61 percent to 2.58 percent, the study showed. One change is that Amazon snagged popular HBO content, including &#x201C;The Wire,&#x201D; &#x201C;True Blood&#x201D; and &#x201C;Boardwalk Empire.&#x201D; Netflix accounts for 32.39 percent of aggregate traffic.</p>
<p>Rumors have been rampant that Amazon plans to let advertisers into its media ecosystem. Amazon has already experimented with ads in some shows, according to tech site Re/code.</p>
<p>For advertisers, the service could be the Holy Grail in terms of targeting. In theory, Amazon could tell if ads viewed online led to purchases on its retail site.</p>
<p>The news that Nielsen will start rating shows on subscription video services starting with Netflix is likely to encourage advertisers who want to make the leap without forcing Amazon to give up its own data.</p>
<p>Amazon will also have leverage over content producers when it comes to the way it chooses to promote shows and movies within its growing ecosystem, a Hollywood source said.</p>
<p>Amazon didn&#x2019;t return a call seeking comment.</p>

If the <em>Post&apos;s</em> report proves accurate, the launch of a larger ad-supported streaming service may mean that the current version successfully enticed Amazon customers to buy Prime. Amazon recently scored a deal to stream classic HBO programs like <em>The Sopranos</em> and <em>Six Feet Under</em> in a minor coup over Netflix. But it still has less than a tenth of its competitor&apos;s size -- and we imagine that &quot;free&quot; looks pretty good to a lot of users, ads or not. So far Amazon hasn&apos;t commented on the matter, but we&apos;ve reached out for more information.</p><p><strong>Update</strong>: Amazon told us it has &quot;not announced any plans to offer an ad-supported video streaming service.&quot; That doesn&apos;t mean that it <em>won&apos;t</em>, though, so let us translate that into non-PR-speak for you: &quot;No comment.&quot; Its full statement is below.</p><blockquote><p>We currently offer the first episode of some television shows free with ads through our First Episode Free feature on Amazon Instant Video, and there are display ads on some short videos such as movie and game trailers.

</p><p> Amazon is reportedly planning to launch an ad-supported media streaming service for music and videos,&#xA0;<a href=""http://nypost.com/2014/11/21/amazon-plans-a-streaming-video-alternative/"">the New York Post reports</a>.
</p><p> The service would exist in addition to its $99 Prime membership subscription, which includes free, two-day shipping on thousands of items alongside music, TV, and movie streaming options.<span>&#xA0;</span>
</p><p><a href=""http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304688104579465690663213198?mod=djemalertTECH""> The Wall Street Journal reported</a> similar plans in March, pegging the service as being free. At the time,&#xA0;<a href=""http://variety.com/2014/digital/news/amazon-is-plotting-free-tv-and-music-video-streaming-service-but-stocked-with-what-1201149147/"">Amazon denied that it had plans</a> to offer a free streaming-media service. &#xA0;
</p><p> The Post, however, doesn&apos;t say that the service would be free, and instead suggests that the new service would likely compete with Netflix and Hulu, while under-cutting them on price (Netflix costs and Hulu Plus cost $7.99 a month).&#xA0;
</p><p> Amazon&apos;s Sally Fouts sent the following via email: &quot;We currently offer the first episode of some television shows free with ads through our&#xA0;First Episode Free feature on Amazon Instant Video, and there are display ads on some short videos such as movie and game trailers. We&#x2019;re often experimenting with new offers and experiences for customers, but we have not announced any plans to offer an ad-supported video streaming service.&quot;
</p> <p> At its core, the idea of this service makes sense.
</p><p> Amazon could use this new, cheaper streaming service as a way to ease people into its ecosystem so they&apos;ll be more likely to eventually make the jump to Prime, while also giving it a way to entice potential customers who don&apos;t care about Prime&apos;s free shipping but want a Netflix alternative.&#xA0;

<p>Word has it that Amazon is looking to launch an ad-supported streaming video service, which could give rivals a run for their money. The online retail giant is planning to roll out the new service early next year, the <em><a href=""http://nypost.com/2014/11/21/amazon-plans-a-streaming-video-alternative/"">New York Post</a></em> reported on Friday. It would be separate from Amazon&apos;s $99 yearly Prime membership, which offers unlimited movie streaming from the Instant Video library.</p>
<p>In a statement, an Amazon spokeswoman neither confirmed nor denied the rumor.</p>

<p>This isn&apos;t the first time we&apos;ve heard this rumor. <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> in March reported that Amazon was planning to launch its own advertising-filled TV streaming service&#xA0;&#x2014; free to users, of course. Amazon, however, quickly <a class="""" href=""http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2455676,00.asp"">shot down that rumor</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;We&apos;re often experimenting with new things, but we have no plans to offer a free streaming-media service,&quot; an Amazon spokesperson said at the time.</p>

<p>But the <em>Post</em>&apos;s sources now say an ad-supported version is definitely happening. But oddly, the report suggests that it might not be free. One source speculated that Amazon may undercut Netflix&apos;s current monthly price of $7.99, though.</p>
<p>&quot;The main point is to bring in more users that you can eventually up-sell to Prime, or to get to a broader audience that doesn&apos;t want to pay for Prime, in order to increase their video share,&quot; a source told the news outlet.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Amazon is already gaining ground on streaming rivals. A recent Sandvine <a href=""https://www.sandvine.com/pr/2014/11/20/sandvine-report-netflix-dominates-still-amazon-instant-video-growing.html"">study</a> found that Amazon Instant Video has established itself as the second largest paid streaming video service in North America, though Netflix still dominates.</p>
<p>Netflix accounted for 34.9 percent of downstream North American traffic in the peak evening hours this year. Amazon had only 2.6 percent of downstream traffic, but its share has more than doubled in the past 18 months, Sandvine said.</p>
<p>On other news, Amazon is also mulling its own travel service, which would let you book stays at independent hotels and resorts, according to a <a href=""http://skift.com/2014/11/20/exclusive-amazon-to-get-into-hotel-booking-with-launch-of-travel-site/"">report</a> from travel news site Skift. The so-called Amazon Travel site, set to launch around Jan. 1, would reportedly &quot;feature a curated selection of hotels within a few&#xA0;hours&apos; drive from New York, Los Angeles, and Seattle.&quot;</p>
<p>Amazon declined to comment about the travel site rumor.</p> <p>For more, check out 16 Tips Every Amazon Addict Should Know in the slideshow above, as well as <a class="""" href=""http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2456217,00.asp"">60 Geeky Movies, TV Shows on Amazon You Should Stream Now</a>.</p>

http://bgr.com/2014/11/21/amazon-free-video-streaming-service/,Amazon reportedly developing a new weapon to combat Netflix,,2014-11-21T23:45:37.000Z,"<div class=""entry-content""> <p>In order to better compete against rivals like Netflix, <a href=""http://bgr.com/tag/amazon/"">Amazon</a> may launch a free, ad-supported streaming video service at some point early next year, <em><a href=""http://nypost.com/2014/11/21/amazon-plans-a-streaming-video-alternative/"">The New York Post</a></em> has learned.<span id=""more-4173324""></span></p>
<p><strong>FROM EARLIER: <a href=""http://bgr.com/2014/11/21/amazon-black-friday-2014-sales/"">Everything you need to know about Amazon&#x2019;s crazy Black Friday doorbuster deals</a></strong></p>
<p>Not many details about the new service are available at this time, and it&#x2019;s not known what Amazon will call it, but it&#x2019;ll apparently be available for free&#xA0;and will not be tethered to Amazon Prime, which already offers unlimited video streaming to subscribers.</p> <p>&#x201C;If they do an ad-supported service, they will decouple it from Prime and that is a <a href=""http://bgr.com/tag/netflix/"">Netflix</a> killer,&#x201D; Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said. &#x201C;It won&#x2019;t be $99 a year. Who wouldn&#x2019;t switch if you were poor or you&#x2019;re a cord-cutter?&#x201D;</p>
<p>One source familiar with Amazon&#x2019;s plans said the retailer wants customers who initially choose the new free streaming option to then convert to Amazon Prime, a subscription that costs $99 per year. At the same time, Amazon also wants to increase its video streaming share, as it&#x2019;s competing against other popular services such as Netflix and Hulu.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The main point is to bring in more users that you can eventually up-sell to Prime, or to get to a broader audience that doesn&#x2019;t want to pay for Prime, in order to increase their video share,&#x201D; the source said.</p>
<p>Amazon is estimated to have some 50 million global Prime members, of which roughly 25 million use the video service included in the subscription.</p>
<p>However, Amazon only has a 2.58% share of broadband traffic, compared to Netflix&#x2019;s 32.39% share of aggregate traffic. Netflix currently has 33 million subscribers in the U.S.</p>
<p>In addition to video streaming, Amazon could also benefit from targeted advertising, as it would be able to tell whether customers actually purchase products on Amazon.com after viewing ads for them while streaming TV shows.</p> <div class=""entry-tags""> Tags: <a href=""http://bgr.com/tag/amazon/"">amazon</a>, <a href=""http://bgr.com/tag/hulu/"">Hulu</a>, <a href=""http://bgr.com/tag/netflix/"">netflix</a> </div> </div>",bgr.com,,316

<p><strong>FROM EARLIER: <a href=""http://bgr.com/2014/10/13/iphone-6-plus-bendgate-apple-fan/"">Yet another Apple fan who mocked &#x2018;Bendgate&#x2019; finds himself disturbed by a slightly bent iPhone 6 Plus</a></strong></p>
<p>Redditor<em> doctorkuddles</em>&#xA0;says that he just purchased an 128GB iPhone 6 Plus that feels different than&#xA0;his wife&#x2019;s early 16GB iPhone 6 Plus model.</p> <p>&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t prove anything. I can only look at my iPhone 6 Plus I got yesterday, and the 6 Plus my wife got on September 20th,&#x201D; he explains. &#x201C;We have identical phones minus the GB size (I have 128GB, she has the 16GB) Both are space gray. I started looking at both phones closely.</p>
<p>&#x201C;First difference I noticed is the smoothness on the week one phone compared to the week 6 (?) phone. Completely softer and smoother. The second difference I noted was when I started tapping (&#x2018;flicking&#x2019;) the back and sides of both phones. Right where the previous &#x2018;bends&#x2019; were in previous 6 Pluses (above and below the volume rocker), there is a night and day difference in sound,&#x201D; he adds.</p>
<p><em>doctorkuddles</em> further says&#xA0;he used a stethoscope to listen to the iPhone 6 Plus and found that his 128GB phone sounds &#x201C;much more dull toned, indicating to me it&#x2019;s more solid&#x201D; whereas &#x201C;her phone had a lot more percussion sound, indicating that area was previously hollow&#x201D;</p>
<p>He then took it under a microscope, without dismantling it. He looked through the cracks of the volume buttons and spotted a &#x201C;red colored object placed in the volume down button crank.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Furthermore, he weighed and measured both devices and found out that while both devices are identical in size, the 128GB version is 21g heavier than the 16GB model.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I just don&#x2019;t see the memory being that much heavier,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>No actual images or videos of any of these findings have been published, so it&#x2019;s not clear whether <em>doctorkuddles</em> has actually discovered anything.</p>
<p>Interestingly, he contacted the teardown experts at iFixit on the matter, who purchased a brand new 128GB iPhone 6 Plus and weighed it.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It weighs 173.5 grams, a whopping 0.8 grams more than the Day One unit,&#x201D; iFixit&#x2019;s <em>mdjorie</em> wrote on the same Reddit thread. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know what&#x2019;s up with your new unit, OP, but our new unit definitely doesn&#x2019;t weigh 21 grams more than the Day One device.&#x201D;</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s not clear whether Apple made any internal design changes to its iPhones since the <a href=""http://bgr.com/tag/bendgate/"">Bendgate</a> issue was first reported, or whether it would be able to roll out changes so fast in case it did. But a previous report did reveal that <a href=""http://bgr.com/2014/09/05/faulty-iphone-6-returns/"">Apple takes product launch-related issues and flaws very seriously</a>&#xA0;and looks&#xA0;to fix problems as fast as possible following their discovery.</p>
<p>UPDATE: <a href=""http://9to5mac.com/2014/10/31/iphone-6-plus-silent-update-weight-difference/""><em>9to5Mac&#x2019;s</em> Jordan Kahn has done some digging</a> and has found that there&#x2019;s no truth to the claim that Apple has altered the 6 Plus to make it less susceptible to bending.</p>
<p>&#x201C;A footnote on Apple&#x2019;s specs website for iPhone 6 Plus notes that &#x201C;Size and weight vary by configuration and manufacturing process,&#x201D; and sources tell us&#xA0;a 1.5 gram weight variance between any two iPhone 6 Plus units&#xA0;is within what is expected,&#x201D; Kahn explains.</p> <div class=""entry-tags""> Tags: <a href=""http://bgr.com/tag/apple/"">Apple</a>, <a href=""http://bgr.com/tag/bendgate/"">Bendgate</a>, <a href=""http://bgr.com/tag/iphone-6-plus/"">iPhone 6 Plus</a> </div> </div>",bgr.com,,621

<p class=""p1"">Earlier today users noticed an increase in weight for newly purchased units of the iPhone 6 Plus compared to the 172grams Apple quotes on its website. Repair guide website iFixit noted in <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/2kqlgh/does_anyone_think_apple_had_quietly_fixed_the_6/"">a Reddit post</a> that it tested a newly purchased device and found a weight difference of 172.7 grams to 173.5 grams. <i>&#x201C;We had a Day One iPhone 6 Plus, 128 GB, Silver, Verizon unit. I put it on the dealer scale we have on-premises, and it weighed 172.7 grams.

<p class=""p1"">The reports have been <a href=""http://bgr.com/2014/10/31/iphone-6-plus-bendgate-design-fix/"">widely picked up</a> by several news sites and some are speculating that the weight difference could be due to added reinforcements to address bending concerns. We&#x2019;ve confirmed, however, that the difference in weight is normal and that newly shipping iPhone 6 Plus units have not been silently altered.</p>
<p class=""p1"">A footnote on Apple&#x2019;s specs website for iPhone 6 Plus notes that &#x201C;Size and weight vary by configuration and manufacturing process,&#x201D; and sources tell us&#xA0;a 1.5 gram weight variance between any two iPhone 6 Plus units&#xA0;is within what is expected.</p>

It sounded good, but unfortunately as it turns out, it might not necessarily have been true, which we have to say is a bit unfortunate.</p><p>This is according to the folks at iFixit who responded to the <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/2kqlgh/does_anyone_think_apple_had_quietly_fixed_the_6/"">original Reddit post</a> with their own findings.

Aside from setting up a third mobile business to target China specifically, rumors are resurfacing that Lenovo is eying to buy <a href=""https://www.slashgear.com/tags/blackberry/"">BlackBerry</a> out of its woes. Or perhaps the two moves are one and the same, which doesn&#x2019;t make sense either. Whatever Lenovo has planned, we might very well know this week as sources close to the matter tip that Lenovo will be making an offer to buy BlackBerry sometime this week.</p> <p>This isn&#x2019;t exactly the first time that the largest PC maker has set its eyes on BlackBerry. It was exactly a year ago since we <a href=""https://www.slashgear.com/lenovo-blackberry-bid-potential-resurfaces-17301949/"">last heard</a> about the Chinese firm&#x2019;s interest in the Canadian company. Of course, neither company confirmed nor denied the matter. The Canadian government, however, was allegedly working in the background to have it blocked, due to security concerns of a Chinese company buying out a Canadian one.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to today, Lenovo is said to make a $15 per share offer to BlackBerry, possibly ending up at around $18 per share. If any of this is true, Lenovo would be what others would call it spreading itself thin across continents. It was lately rumored to be planning on starting <a href=""https://www.slashgear.com/lenovo-to-step-up-in-china-by-starting-a-new-phone-brand-16350890/"">a new mobile phone venture</a> in China specifically to rival top dog Xiaomi while still maintaining its own Lenovo branded smartphones in that country. In the US, it is still waiting to conclude the acquisition of <a href=""https://www.slashgear.com/tags/motorola/"">Motorola Mobility</a>, whose name and sales also extend to other countries. If it does or at least tries to acquire BlackBerry, then it means that the company is willing to have a fourth mobile business under its control.</p>
<p>The other big question is whether BlackBerry is willing to sell. There have been many rumors and offers during the height of the company&#x2019;s financial crisis, none of which have come to pass as BlackBerry has soldiered on to keep its own brand and business under its own direction. If you only look at news coverage, the company doesn&#x2019;t seem to be in as dire straits, which makes the prospect of a buyout even less enticing. Plus, the company has just launched a fresh new attempt at both the smartphone and the enterprise market, and isn&#x2019;t exactly done yet. Whether those are actually enough to keep BlackBerry afloat is too early to tell, which might be another reason it would not be so interested in an acquisition.</p>

<h3><strong>Lenovo plans smart devices</strong></h3>
<p>On Wednesday, Lenovo stated that it is planning to launch its internet-based smart devices on Apr. 1, 2015. Also it was reported that the company will operate under a separate name and brand. A BlackBerry spokesperson told Benzinga that the company would not respond to rumors or speculations, and a Lenovo spokesperson was not available for the comment.</p>
<p>Lenovo CFO Wong Wai Ming said in January 2013 that the Canadian smartphone maker was under consideration from the company. However, BlackBerry declined any such possibility that time. Only last year, the <a href=""http://www.valuewalk.com/2014/07/blackberry-ltd-bbry-preferred-by-german-government/"">government</a> banned a potential BlackBerry deal with Lenovo due to some national security issues.</p>
<h3><strong>BlackBerry shipment estimates lowered</strong></h3>
<p>Recently analyst Todd Coupland at CIBC World Markets speculated&#xA0;that the estimated shipment volume for BlackBerry devices for the third and fourth quarters would be weak. Coupland added though that the initial demand for the BlackBerry Passport is encouraging compared to modest expectations. Coupland noted that on Google Trends, there was an increased search interest for the device that was similar to the BB10&#x2019;s number two devices. Also the Canadian company sold an unexpected 200,000 units of the Passport on the very first day of its launch.</p>
<p>Coupland said, &#x201C;Shipments, however, are being held back by supply constraints for unique screens and keyboards that will limit any upside in fiscal Q3.&#x201D;</p>
<p>According to the analyst, demand for BB7 and Z30 devices of BlackBerry is going down, therefore, shipment forecasts for BlackBerry devices have been revised down from 2.3 million units to 1.6 million units for the third quarter. Additionally, for the fourth-quarter, his shipment estimate is down from 2.5 million units to 1.5 million.</p>
<p>BlackBerry CEO John Chen is expecting total <a href=""http://www.valuewalk.com/2014/10/blackberry-shipment-estimates-reduced/"">shipments</a>&#xA0;to hit 10 million units annually by 2017. Coupland says that the company still has a lot to do to revive its position in hardware before it can achieve its target and expects the company to ship only 6.8 million units in 2016 and 2017.</p> <div class=""tag_list"">Tags: <a href=""http://www.valuewalk.com/tag/bbry/"">BBRY</a> <a href=""http://www.valuewalk.com/tag/blackberry/"">BlackBerry</a> <a href=""http://www.valuewalk.com/tag/john-chen/"">John Chen</a> <a href=""http://www.valuewalk.com/tag/lenovo/"">lenovo</a> <a href=""http://www.valuewalk.com/tag/passport/"">Passport</a> <a href=""http://www.valuewalk.com/tag/shipments/"">shipments</a></div> </div> </article>",www.valuewalk.com,,394

<p>According to a Saturday <a href=""http://www.benzinga.com/news/14/10/4933512/exclusive-lenovo-could-make-an-offer-for-blackberry-as-early-as-this-week"" class=""external"">Benzinga</a> report that references &#x201C;a source familiar with the matter&#x201D;, it has been revealed that Chinese computer maker Lenovo Group (<span>OTCBB:LNVGY</span>) could make an offer to acquire Canadian telecommunication and wireless equipment company BlackBerry Ltd. (<span>BBRY</span>) as early as this week. The source told the publication that Lenovo&#x2019;s first offer for the struggling smartphone maker would be &#x201C;$15.00 per share, with a deal ultimately getting done around $18.00 per share.&#x201D;</p>
<p>This isn&#x2019;t the first time the $15 billion market cap company has been linked with BlackBerry. In January 2013, Lenovo&#x2019;s chief financial officer Wong Wai Ming told <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-24/lenovo-says-rim-bid-among-options-to-boost-mobile-unit.html"" class=""external"">Bloomberg</a> &#x201C;We are looking at all opportunities &#x2013; RIM [still known as Research in Motion at that time] and many others. We&#x2019;ll have no hesitation if the right opportunity comes along.&#x201D;</p>
<p>BlackBerry played down the comment. Later that month Canadian Industry Minister Christian Paradis said that he would prefer the smarthone maker to grow &#x201C;organically.&#x201D; The Canadian government reportedly stopped Lenovo&#x2019;s takeover of BlackBerry due to national security concerns.</p>
<p>BlackBerry declined to comment to Benzinga on a possible Lenovo bid.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The company does not comment on rumors or speculation,&#x201D; said a spokesman for the Waterloo, Ontario-based company.</p>
<p>BBRY climbed 2.04 percent to $9.49 at the close in New York&#x2019;s Friday Nas session.</p> </div> </article>",wallstreetpit.com,,213

<p>Lenovo has already purchased Motorola from Google, and now according to a recent report, the company is interested in another smartphone maker, BlackBerry.</p>
<p>Back in<a href=""http://www.geeky-gadgets.com/lenovo-might-be-interested-in-acquiring-blackberry-says-a-report-17-10-2013/""> October</a> of last year, we heard rumors that Lenovo were interested in buying BlackBerry, and according to a recent report, Lenovo are still interested in the acquisition.</p> <p>Lenovo are rumored to be offering around $15 per share for BlackBerry, and may even increase that to around $18 per share, which is quite a bit higher than their current price of around $9.50.</p>
<p>BlackBerry has been turning things around recently, the latest financial results were better than expected, and the company appears to be doing better with their new BlackBerry Passport handsets than previous devices.</p>
<p>Lenovo has big plans for their new smartphone business, and intends to launch a new subsidiary in China that will focus solely on smartphones, so BlackBerry could be a smart buy for the company.</p>
<p>As soon as we get some more details on whether Lenovo will be making an offer on BlackBerry, we will let you guys know.</p>

<strong>UPDATE #2:</strong> <a href=""https://consumerist.com/2014/10/08/comcast-apologizes-for-customers-bad-service-but-not-for-role-in-getting-him-fired/"">Comcast has apologized for the horrible service and billing that Conal experienced during his year-plus as a customer, but says that &#x201C;nobody at Comcast asked for him to be fired.&#x201D;</a></p>

<p>When you complain to your cable company, you certainly don&#x2019;t expect that the cable company will then contact your employer and discuss your complaint. But that&#x2019;s exactly what happened to one former Comcast customer who says he was fired after the cable company called a partner at his accounting firm.</p>
<aside class=""lf-aside-right""><span><strong>TL;DR Version</strong></span><br>
&#x2022; Customer spends 11 months&#xA0;being overcharged by Comcast.&#x2022; Customer&#x2019;s complaints go unresolved.
<p>&#x2022; Customer contacts office of Comcast&#x2019;s Controller to complain about billing practices.</p>
<p>&#x2022; Comcast contacts customer&#x2019;s employer, which happens to do a lot of business with Comcast, says customer used employer&#x2019;s name during complaint.</p>
<p>&#x2022; Customer insists he did not use company name; fired by employer anyway.</p>
<p>&#x2022; Comcast will not release e-mails or audio recordings to counter customer&#x2019;s claim that he didn&#x2019;t use the name of his employer.</p>

<h4>IT BEGAN INNOCENTLY ENOUGH&#x2026;</h4>
<p>Conal began subscribing to Comcast service in early 2013 after he says he was sold a 9-month promotional pricing offer. But from the start, there were issues with his service, as he was being charged for set-top boxes that had yet to be activated. Additionally, someone at Comcast billing had misspelled Conal&#x2019;s last name, meaning some of his bills were not being delivered.</p>
<p>He says he met with a Comcast rep in May 2013 about the billing issues and promised they would all be sorted out, but things only got worse.</p>
<p>A few months later, the promotional discount shrunk and Conal&#x2019;s monthly bill increased by $20, in addition to still being charged for unactivated devices in his house. Comcast also twice charged him an additional $7 for a second modem he did not have.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, attempts to get a resolution from Comcast went unanswered.</p>
<h4>CUTTING THE CORD</h4>
<p>He attempted to cancel his service in Oct. 2013 but says a Comcast rep convinced him that the billing issues would be resolved and that he would get free DVR service and The Movie Channel for three months as compensation.</p>
<p>But things didn&#x2019;t just continue as they had before; Comcast somehow managed to sink even lower than it had before, sending Conal about a dozen pieces of equipment that he didn&#x2019;t order.</p>
<p>&#x201C;There were a few DVRs, modem, standard boxes and equipment that I was unfamiliar with,&#x201D; he says.</p>
<p>Making matters worse, Comcast billed him $1,820 for all this stuff he&#x2019;d never requested and had no use for.</p>
<p>When Conal returned all the equipment to Comcast and, being an experienced accountant at one of the nation&#x2019;s most prestigious firms, even prepared a spreadsheet detailing every charge, overcharge, payment and credit on his account for his brief time as a Comcast customer.</p>
<p>He says even this didn&#x2019;t convince Comcast that there was a problem and that Conal had been overcharged. And even though it wasn&#x2019;t yet past due, Comcast sent Conal&#x2019;s account into collections in Feb. 2014.</p>
<h4>THE CALL IN QUESTION</h4>
<p>And so on Feb. 6, 2014, he chose to try going above Comcast&#x2019;s customer service, which hadn&#x2019;t been of any help in the year he&#x2019;d been a subscriber, and instead contacted the office of the company&#x2019;s Controller. He spoke to someone in that office who promised Conal would receive a call back to address the issues.</p>
<p>He describes that callback as &#x201C;bizarre,&#x201D; with the rep not identifying which company she was calling from, just starting out with &#x201C;How can I help you?&#x201D; Then she kept insisting that a technician had shown up for an appointment, but wouldn&#x2019;t specify which appointment. The rep then began asking him for the color of his house.</p>
<p>So he tried the Controller&#x2019;s office again, to let them know that the rep they&#x2019;d sent his way had failed miserably at her job.</p>
<p>During this call, he says that he mentioned that Comcast&#x2019;s billing and accounting issues should probably be investigated by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), a private-sector oversight operation. This ultimately led to two service calls where no one ever showed up and no explanations were given.</p>
<p>But something did happen. Just not anything good.</p>
<h4>WE KNOW WHERE YOU WORK</h4>
<p>Remember how we briefly mentioned above that Conal worked for a large, prestigious accounting firm? Comcast certainly noticed that fact, especially since that firm is one that does business with Comcast.</p>
<p>At some point shortly after that call, someone from Comcast contacted a partner at the firm to discuss Conal. This led to an ethics investigation and Conal&#x2019;s subsequent dismissal from his job; a job where he says he&#x2019;d only received positive feedback and reviews for his work.</p>
<p>Comcast maintained that Conal used the name of his employer in an attempt to get leverage. Conal insists that he never mentioned his employer by name, but believes that someone in the Comcast Controller&#x2019;s office looked him up online and figured out where he worked.</p>
<p>When he was fired, Conal&#x2019;s employer explained that the reason for the dismissal was an e-mail from Comcast that summarized conversations between Conal and Comcast employees.</p>
<p>But Conal has never seen this e-mail in order to say whether it&#x2019;s accurate and Comcast has thus far refused to release any tapes of the phone calls related to this matter.</p>
<p>And while his former employer did provide consulting services to Comcast, it was not the accounting firm that audited Comcast&#x2019;s books. So Conal doesn&#x2019;t quite see how mentioning the name of his employer would have helped gain him any leverage.</p>
<p>In response to a letter from Conal&#x2019;s lawyer &#x2014; he has not filed a lawsuit, but it&#x2019;s not out of the question &#x2014; Comcast&#x2019;s Senior Deputy General Counsel admits that the company did contact Conal&#x2019;s employer but says that Conal &#x201C;is not in a position to complain that the firm came to learn&#x201D; about his dispute with Comcast.</p>
<h4>THE HEART OF THE MATTER</h4>
<p>I think whether or not Conal mentioned his employer is beside the point. The problem should not have reached the point where he was even reaching out the Comcast Controller&#x2019;s office.</p>
<p>Had the billing issues been fixed on the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth chance that he gave Comcast to address the issue, the call in question would never have happened.</p>
<p>And even if Conal did identify his employer in the hope of getting his billing issue fixed, he wouldn&#x2019;t have been trying to get preferential treatment; just the service he&#x2019;d paid for.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m also curious why, even though Comcast insists that Conal attempted to leverage his place of business to get his issue resolved, it has not specifically cited language that he allegedly used in the call.</p>
<p>How many times a day do Comcast reps hear a customer say something like &#x201C;I&#x2019;m a lawyer&#x201D; or &#x201C;I&#x2019;m a big shot at [fill in the blank]&#x201D;? How many of those result in Comcast going out of its way to contact that customer&#x2019;s employer?</p>
<p>We reached out to Comcast to ask whether it&#x2019;s company policy to contact customers&#x2019; employers. No one answered that question, but a rep for Comcast did give a brief statement.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Our customers deserve the best experience every time they interact with us,&#x201D; reads the statement. Comcast says it has previously apologized to Conal, but adds &#x201C;we will review his lawyer&#x2019;s letter and respond as quickly as possible.&#x201D;</p>

<p>There have been lots of &#x201C;Comcast delivers bad customer service&#x201D; stories lately &#x2014; so overwhelming, in fact, <a href=""http://www.phillymag.com/news/2014/09/26/comcast-names-exec-charge-making-customers-less-ragey/"">that the company just appointed an executive to solve the problem</a>&#xA0;amid worries that <a href=""http://www.phillymag.com/news/2014/10/01/will-customer-service-kill-comcast-merger/"">disgruntled customers could derail the company&#x2019;s merger with Time Warner&#xA0;</a>&#x2014; but the latest story may be the worst: A Comcast customer says the company got him fired from the job.</p> <p><a href=""http://consumerist.com/2014/10/06/unhappy-customer-comcast-told-my-employer-about-complaint-got-me-fired/"">Consumerist reports</a> that the customer &#x2014; known in the story only as &#x201C;<strong>Conal</strong>&#x201D; &#x2014; began subscribing to Comcast in 2013 under a promotional offer, but almost immediately found himself charged for set-top boxes that had not been activated. He says he met with a Comcast rep in May of that year to sort out the billing issues, but they actually got worse from there.</p>
<p>He attempted to cancel, but was persuaded to stay for three free months of The Movie Channel; the company ended up sending&#xA0;him items he hadn&#x2019;t&#xA0;order and charged him more than $1,800 for them. Conal, an accountant, then contacted Comcast&#x2019;s controller. Consumerist reports: &#x201C;During this call, he says that he mentioned that Comcast&#x2019;s billing and accounting issues should probably be investigated by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), a private-sector oversight operation.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s where the problem develops: Comcast learned where Conal was employed. It just happened to be a company that does business with Comcast.</p>
<p>Consumerist reports that Conal claims he never named the company when he was on the phone with various customer service reps &#x2014; he believes Comcast must&#x2019;ve looked up the information somehow. Nonetheless:</p>
<blockquote><p>At some point shortly after that call, someone from Comcast contacted a partner at the firm to discuss Conal. This led to an ethics investigation and Conal&#x2019;s subsequent dismissal from his job; a job where he says he&#x2019;d only received positive feedback and reviews for his work.</p>
<p>When he was fired, Conal&#x2019;s employer explained that the reason for the dismissal<strong> was an e-mail from Comcast that summarized conversations between Conal and Comcast employees.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Emphasis added.</p>
<p>Consumerist, never a Comcast-friendly publication to begin with, seethes:</p>
<p>&#x201C;I think whether or not Conal mentioned his employer is beside the point. The problem should not have reached the point where he was even reaching out the Comcast Controller&#x2019;s office,&#x201D; writer Chris Moran says. &#x201C;Had the billing issues been fixed on the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth chance that he gave Comcast to address the issue, the call in question would never have happened. &#xA0;And even if Conal did identify his employer in the hope of getting his billing issue fixed, he wouldn&#x2019;t have been trying to get preferential treatment; just the service he&#x2019;d paid for.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Comcast told Consumerist it &#x201C;will&#xA0;review (Conal&#x2019;s)&#xA0;lawyer&#x2019;s letter and respond as quickly as possible.&#x201D;</p> </div> <p class=""entry-tags"">Read More About: <a href=""http://www.phillymag.com/tag/comcast/"">Comcast</a></p> </article><div id=""text-29"" class=""widget_text""> <div class=""textwidget""><p>Be respectful of our online community and contribute to an engaging conversation.

<p><em><strong>Update, Oct. 8, 11 a.m.:</strong> Ars Technica <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/10/comcast-got-me-fired-after-billing-dispute-says-california-man/"">confirmed the account</a> described in this story over lunch last Friday with the man, Conal O&apos;Rourke, in Northern California. O&apos;Rourke was fired from his job at PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC) earlier this year after his extended dispute with Comcast. Ars Technica reports that he provided &quot;an astonishing amount of documentation&quot; and is threatening to sue Comcast if the company does not apologize, retract its comments to his employer, restore his job, and pay him $100,312.50 by Oct. 14.<br>
 </em></p>


</div>


<div class=""text-2 text parbase section"">

<p><em>Innovative</em> might not be the first word that comes to mind in describing Comcast. But are we giving the company credit where credit is due? Let&apos;s face it, after that harrowing <a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/07/15/comcast_rep_refuses_to_cancel_service_listen_to_the_customer_service_call.html"">18-minute customer service call</a> went viral in July, it looked like Comcast had nothing more to strive for&#x2014;it had reached peak horrible. Yet if reports this week are accurate, Comcast has continued to shine as an innovator in the competitive field of corporate terribleness: It got a customer&apos;s employer to fire him for complaining about shoddy customer service.</p>


</div>







<div class=""text-3 text parbase section"">

<p>The <a href=""http://consumerist.com/2014/10/06/unhappy-customer-comcast-told-my-employer-about-complaint-got-me-fired/"">full story in all its sadistic glory is at <em>Consumerist</em></a><em>,</em> but here&apos;s the SparkNotes version. A customer named &quot;Conal&quot; started subscribing to Comcast service in early 2013. There were issues: erroneous charges, bills that never arrived, discounts that weren&apos;t applied. Conal considered canceling his service, but decided to stick with it after a Comcast rep promised that the issues would be resolved and threw in some free perks. As another friendly gesture, the company also allegedly sent and billed Conal for $1,820 of equipment he&apos;d never ordered.</p>


</div>








<div class=""text parbase text-4 section"">

<p>This is where it gets crazy. Conal, understandably frustrated, decided to bypass the customer service department and take his complaints straight to the Comcast controller. During the call, he claims, he suggested that a private-sector oversight group look into Comcast&apos;s billing and accounting issues. Shortly after that call, Comcast contacted Conal&apos;s employer&#x2014;a large accounting firm that <a href=""http://consumerist.com/2014/10/06/unhappy-customer-comcast-told-my-employer-about-complaint-got-me-fired/""><em>Consumerist</em> reports</a> happened to do business with Comcast. The rep claimed that Conal had name-dropped his employer as leverage during the call; according to the story, the firm opened an investigation against Conal and then fired him from his job.</p>


</div>

<p>It&apos;s hard to know who&apos;s telling the truth here. Conal <a href=""http://consumerist.com/2014/10/06/unhappy-customer-comcast-told-my-employer-about-complaint-got-me-fired/"">tells <em>Consumerist</em></a> that he never mentioned his employer and that someone at Comcast must have looked him up to figure out where he worked. Comcast, for its part, has allegedly refused to release any tapes of the phone calls it made on the matter. That&apos;s a little strange: If Conal did invoke his company&apos;s name in a threatening way, Comcast could easily prove as much by excerpting the relevant portion of his call. So much for monitoring &quot;for quality assurance purposes.&quot; If you want it done right, <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/comcast-admits-it-issues-refunds-if-you-record-calls-2014-8"">record the call yourself</a>.<br>

(See correction below) </p>  <p class=""speakable""> O&apos;Rourke told CNET and the Consumerist, which first reported the story, that problems with his Comcast service and bill go back to at least February 2013. Charges totaling $1,820 appeared for equipment he never received and didn&apos;t need. While those charges were removed after his complaint, his account still ended up with<strong> </strong>a collections agency last February. </p> <p> O&apos;Rourke<strong> </strong>told the CNN that he contacted Comcast&apos;s corporate office. &quot;I had a pleasant initial conversation,&quot; he said. &quot;From there it went bad. It was aggressive.&quot; </p> <p> He said he suggested Comcast&apos;s billing practices should be investigated, and questioned whether the revenue the company is reporting to investors is accurate &quot;with everybody having billing problems.&quot; </p>  <p> Comcast notified PricewaterhouseCoopers that a person claiming to be a PwC employee called its chief accounting executive&apos;s office with complaints about his cable service and bills, and yelled at its employees who tried to assist him, according to a letter one of its attorneys sent to Maureen Ryan, O&apos;Rourke&apos;s attorney.<strong> </strong> </p> <p> Ryan said Comcast told PwC that O&apos;Rourke had tried to use his employment there as leverage in making his complaints. &quot;They went to his employer and said he had violated accounting ethics,&quot; she said. &quot;That&apos;s not a minor charge to make.&quot; </p> <p> Both Ryan and O&apos;Rourke deny he committed any ethics violation or even let Comcast know he worked for PwC. </p>  <div class=""cnnplayer"" id=""cnnplayer1""> <div class=""cnnVidplayer"">  </div>  </div> <p> O&apos;Rourke had a non-accounting staff position at<strong> </strong>PricewaterhouseCoopers. The firm said he was fired after an investigation determined that he violated its standards and practices. </p> <p> Comcast&apos;s new vice president of customer experience, Charlie Herrin, has issued a public apology to O&apos;Rourke, admitting that his service problems with the company were completely unacceptable. But he denied that the company sought to have him fired. </p> <p> &quot;What happened with Mr. O&apos;Rourke&apos;s service is completely unacceptable,&quot; said Herrin&apos;s. &quot;Despite our attempts to address Mr. O&apos;Rourke&apos;s issues, we simply dropped the ball and did not make things right. Mr. O&apos;Rourke deserves another apology from us and we&apos;re making this one publicly.&quot; </p> <p> O&apos;Rourke said Comcast did not contact him directly with its apology. In fact, that he didn&apos;t find out about it when he was contacted by the press. He and his attorney say the apology and fixing the billing problems doesn&apos;t go nearly far enough. They are seeking financial damages as well as reinstatement to his job. </p> <p> O&apos;Rourke said he doesn&apos;t have any regrets about what he told Comcast that led to his firing. </p> <p> &quot;I don&apos;t know how I could have handled it any differently,&quot; he told CNN. &quot;I tried for months and months and months to just have somebody look at my bill.&quot; </p> <p> Comcast has one of the <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2014/05/20/news/companies/cable-customer-satisfaction/"">worst customer service reputations</a> of any U.S. company.

<p>OAKLAND, CA&#x2014;Speaking over lunch last Friday, a Northern California man named Conal O&apos;Rourke laid out what admittedly sounds like a crazy story: a year-long billing dispute over his home Comcast service that ultimately resulted in Comcast getting O&apos;Rourke fired from his job at <a href=""http://www.pwc.com/"">PriceWaterhouseCoopers</a> (PWC) in nearby San Jose earlier this year.</p>
<p>But O&#x2019;Rourke arrived to last week&#x2019;s lunch meeting with Ars with an astonishing amount of documentation: he has pages and pages of Comcast invoices. He has a spreadsheet, photos, notes, business cards, and complaint letters. He and his lawyer, <a href=""http://www.dhillonlaw.com/ryan"">Maureen Pettibone Ryan</a>, happily provided digital copies of these materials to Ars, which we have re-published with his permission here.</p>
<p>As a result of his firing, O&#x2019;Rourke has hired a local attorney and is now threatening to file a lawsuit against Comcast if the company does not agree to his <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1309785-20141002-orourke-reply-letter-final.html"">demands</a>, which include &quot;a full retraction and apology, his re-employment with his former employer, and $100,312.50&quot; by October 14.</p>
<h2>A rogue $26.25</h2>
<p>O&#x2019;Rourke first moved to California in early 2012 after 20 years of working for Andersen Consulting (later Accenture) in Connecticut, most recently as part of the corporate controllership division. During his career, O&apos;Rourke developed skills in accounting, financial analysis, and auditing&#x2014;skills that proved useful in his eventual dispute with Comcast.</p>
<p>In February 2013, he moved to a new place in San Jose and signed up for TV and Internet service with Comcast, since the only other competitive service, AT&amp;T&#x2019;s U-Verse, was not available in his building.</p>
<p>&quot;I was roped into Comcast, and with Comcast, my problems soon began,&quot; O&apos;Rourke said.</p>
<p>His first issues began when, after six weeks of service, he had yet to receive a bill.</p>
<p>After eventually&#xA0;receiving his <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1309776-account-invoices.html"">first bill</a> in April 2013, O&apos;Rourke noticed a number of problems. For one thing, his name was misspelled (an issue that never got corrected).</p>
<p>More importantly, O&#x2019;Rourke noticed that Comcast was charging him for three <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1309776-account-invoices.html#document/p55/a181277"">&quot;additional HD outlets&quot; for an extra fee of $26.25</a>&#xA0;a month. He also was charged for cable boxes that he says he never activated (he planned on moving two additional TVs later on into his condominium), after allegedly being promised that he wouldn&#x2019;t be.</p>
<p>Finally, as part of a promotional deal, O&apos;Rourke says he was promised HBO and other premium channels for nine months, but they disappeared after just three.</p>
<p>O&#x2019;Rourke said he called multiple times to try to get these issues resolved. When they weren&#x2019;t, he finally walked into his nearest Comcast store in San Jose.</p>
<p>There he met with the assistant store manager, who gave him a business card and provided his personal cellphone number. &quot;He promises me that it will all be addressed and that we&apos;re going to look at it,&quot; O&#x2019;Rourke said.</p>
<p>Then the real problems began.</p>
<h2>$1,820 in equipment he didn&apos;t order</h2>
<p>For the next few months, O&#x2019;Rourke says he was under deadlines at work and could not address issues with Comcast.</p>
<p>By October 2013, O&#x2019;Rourke said that his Internet speeds suddenly dropped off, becoming &quot;unworkable.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I had contacted them regarding lack of responsiveness and performance issues; sometimes my service wouldn&apos;t be usable and I had to hotspot in with AT&amp;T,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Again he called, and again, Comcast promised to correct his problem&#x2014;sometimes by sending technicians to his home&#x2014;but according to O&apos;Rourke, the company never did.</p>
<p>O&#x2019;Rourke spent part of November and December 2013 traveling overseas, so he was surprised when he returned home to find several boxes at his doorstep containing &quot;12 pieces of equipment&quot; and a <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1309776-account-invoices.html#document/p55/a181277"">December 2013 monthly bill for over $2,000&#x2014;including $1,820 in equipment that he insists he did not order</a>.</p>
<p>According to the December 2013 invoice, O&#x2019;Rourke was charged for devices including an &quot;AnyRoom Hub&quot; ($420) and a &quot;Pace Host&quot; ($110). On December 30, 2013, carrying these various boxes back, O&apos;Rourke walked into the same San Jose Comcast store to return the gear and get his issues resolved.</p>
<p>When he took a service ticket at 1:59pm, he discovered that he was Ticket #395&#xA0;but&#xA0;that the store was only on Ticket #251. Rather than spend his afternoon at the store, O&#x2019;Rourke came up with a plan.</p>
<p>&quot;They close at 7:00pm, so I thought, I&apos;m going to go at 6:45pm, then somebody will have a fire underneath them to address the problems,&quot; he said. &quot;I had had it up to here.&quot;</p>

<p>A Comcast employee named Matt Doblias ended up helping O&#x2019;Rourke, took back the equipment, and cleared the charges. But that still didn&#x2019;t get to the root of the errors that had now persisted for months. (Ars sent an e-mail to Doblias, which bounced.)</p>
<p>&quot;I provided Matt with the <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1309772-gmail-account-reconciliation.html"">detailed spreadsheet</a> in person, and he asked if I could send it to him, and he would take a look,&quot; O&#x2019;Rourke said. The next day, December 31, he did so, but Doblias &quot;responded that the spreadsheet never came through. I sent it again, then at the end of the day I asked for follow up and never heard back.&quot;</p>
<p>O&#x2019;Rourke got irritated.</p>
<p>&quot;On January 11, 2014, I was frustrated because I felt that I had done everything,&quot; he said. &quot;I sent [Doblias] an e-mail that I was hopeful would ignite him to do something. What I did was [show Doblias by e-mail that] I sarcastically wrote a letter [to Comcast Senior Vice President Lawrence Salva], <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1309773-gmail-electronic-copy-mr-lawrence-j-salva.html"">recommending Doblias for the Employee of the Month award</a>. I wrote it up but didn&apos;t put it in the mail. I wanted to give [Doblias] an opportunity to fix the problem.&quot;</p>
<p>The letter included lines like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class=""DV-textContents"">The reason why I have chosen to nominate the San Jose center is simple. Their blatant disregard for the customer has made resolving my issues next to impossible. This behavior has proven to be quite profitable as I, like most customers, just throw their hands up in exasperation. However, now that I am no longer exasperated I intend on following up on my concerns.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But&#xA0;O&apos;Rourke heard nothing, and the billing errors persisted&#x2014;resulting in Comcast allegedly sending a collections agency after him.</p>
<p>&quot;On February 5, 2014, [Comcast] said my account was two months past due and at that <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1309776-account-invoices.html#document/p62/a181280"">point pushing $300</a>,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&apos;t order pay-per-view, and I explained [to the collections agency] that that can&apos;t be right, and they were insistent, and I walked them through it.&quot;</p>
<p><blockquote class=""pullquote right""><div class=""pullquote-content"">She said, &#x2018;What color is your house?!? Tell me the color of your house!&#x2019; She went on a tirade and said, &#x2018;Just answer the&#xA0;question!&#x2019;</div></blockquote>By this point, O&#x2019;Rourke had yet to receive an errorless bill, he said, despite having been a customer for nearly a year. The following day, he decided to contact <a href=""http://corporate.comcast.com/news-information/leadership-overview/lawrence-j-salva"">Lawrence Salva</a>, Comcast&#x2019;s Philadelphia-based controller, who oversees the division of the company that deals with accounting. He spoke at length with Salva&#x2019;s executive assistant, describing his litany of problems. After the call concluded, the assistant said that she would have another Comcast employee contact O&#x2019;Rourke directly.</p>
<p>&quot;An hour later I got a second call from an individual who doesn&apos;t identify herself [except as Evelyn] but says that she&apos;s with Comcast,&quot; he said. O&#x2019;Rourke asked her if she knew why she was calling, to which she responded that it had something to do with missed appointments.</p>
<p>&quot;I laughed, because they missed so many appointments I don&apos;t even know which one she&apos;s talking about,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>When he tried to explain the situation, O&apos;Rourke said that Evelyn began to berate him.</p>
<p>&quot;She said, &#x2018;What color is your house?!? Tell me the color of your house!&#x2019;&quot; O&#x2019;Rourke remembered. &quot;She went on a tirade and said, &#x2018;Just answer the question!&#x2019;&quot; (O&apos;Rourke lives in a condo complex.)</p>
<p>&quot;I told her that I was angry and said, &#x2018;You need to do your homework before you pick up the phone,&#x2019;&quot; he told Ars. &quot;I told her I was going to call back to Salva&apos;s office. That&apos;s what I did. And I expressed my concern and said, &apos;You have sloppy accounting, you don&apos;t take anything seriously, and I should go to the <a href=""http://pcaobus.org/"">Public Company Accounting Oversight Board</a>.&apos; That&apos;s the regulator that makes sure that accounting is done properly. I think that some of my terminology would have indicated that I wasn&apos;t a layman. I worked for 20 years in corporate comptrollership. These errors become material after a while.&quot;</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to O&#x2019;Rourke, however, his call set off alarm bells within Comcast.</p> <p><em>Listing image by <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/alykat/115643524/in/photolist-bdGMS-5q2Yzy-7axde-7avLZ-7axhE-7avQf-2Espi-PBBt-6o2Azu-6fa8js-5HoCCA-dRQr9b-KNEAf-KNNnV-KNGMb-KNENG-KNFBf-KNEEb-KNEJJ-KNh9Q-KNxur-KNqbM-KNFpw-KNtdp-KNe8W-KNuyp-KNjZf-KNBEw-KNfvC-KNfS5-KND4j-KNGx1-KNfd7-KNrnX-KNsBM-KNiYW-KNvoz-KNgU1-KNQAM-KNBo5-KNSoZ-KNuuD-KNuJV-KNqVB-KNqHF-KNt4B-KNdYb-KNAcG-KNj4E-KNfhs"">Alyson Hurt</a></em></p> </div><hr><h4>Page 2</h4><div class=""article-content post-page""> <p>According to O&apos;Rourke, someone within Salva&#x2019;s office immediately began conducting Internet research on him&#xA0;and determined that he was a PWC employee. (According to Salva&apos;s <a href=""http://corporate.comcast.com/news-information/leadership-overview/lawrence-j-salva"">bio</a>, before joining Comcast in 2000 he was &quot;a partner with PricewaterhouseCoopers&#xA0;for over 12 years.&quot;) A letter written by O&apos;Rourke&apos;s lawyer describes what allegedly happened next:</p>
<blockquote><p>Because Comcast was a major consulting services client of PWC&#x2019;s, someone from the Controller&#x2019;s office contacted Mr. Joseph Atkinson, a partner in the Philadelphia office of PWC, and falsely told Mr. Atkinson that Mr. O&#x2019;Rourke had invoked his employment with PWC in an attempt to somehow obtain leverage in his negotiations with Comcast. Mr. Atkinson informed Mr. O&#x2019;Rourke that the client was very valuable, was the Philadelphia office&#x2019;s largest client with billings [REDACTED], that the client was very angry as a result of Mr. O&#x2019;Rourke&#x2019;s complaints, and that Mr. O&#x2019;Rourke was not to speak with anyone from Comcast. While all of this was happening, Comcast continued to communicate sporadically and ineffectively with Mr. O&#x2019;Rourke, setting up two service appointments that they missed without explanation on February 7, 2014 and February 11, 2014.</p></blockquote>
<p>O&apos;Rourke says that on February 7, 2014, he was subjected to an internal PWC ethics investigation as a result of the call. On February 18, O&apos;Rourke was terminated. O&apos;Rourke&apos;s letter says that he was &quot;shocked, humiliated and ashamed based on the unjustified loss of his job. He sought counseling and was prescribed medication to address his emotional distress.&quot;</p>
<p>O&#x2019;Rourke told me that his firing came as a complete shock. &quot;I was totally taken aback,&quot; he said. &quot;I was numb. I was absolutely numb.&quot;</p>
<p>On March 10, 2014, O&#x2019;Rourke finally cut all ties to Comcast.</p>
<p>&quot;I begged AT&amp;T to give me service, and they did&#x2014;it only took a week,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>On July 28, O&apos;Rourke&apos;s lawyer, Maureen Ryan, sent an <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310811-20140728-orourke-demand-letter.html"">initial demand letter</a> to Comcast. On August 18, Comcast&#x2019;s senior deputy corporate counsel, Thomas Nathan, <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1309769-20140821-orourke-conal-response-to-demand-letter.html"">responded</a> to Ryan, telling her that Comcast had not received Ryan&apos;s letter in time to meet her deadline for action. So Ryan sent a second letter.</p>
<p>(Nathan&apos;s response letter does acknowledge that &quot;Comcast communicated to PWC that a person claiming to be a PWC employee had called our&#xA0;chief accounting executive&apos;s office with complaints about his cable service and bills, and yelled&#xA0;at our employees who tried to assist him.&quot; But Nathan asserts those statements were &quot;neither untrue nor unprivileged.&#xA0;As such, they cannot be defamatory. Comcast unequivocally denies your assertion that it&#xA0;requested PWC to fire Mr. O&apos;Rourke.&quot;)</p>
<p>As the <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1309785-20141002-orourke-reply-letter-final.html"">new demand letter states</a>, O&apos;Rourke wants $100,000 in compensation&#x2014;and he wants to return to his old post at PWC in San Jose. Why ask Comcast about a job at PWC? Because, Ryan tells Ars, PWC believed Comcast, and &quot;we didn&apos;t feel that contacting them would do any good until Comcast retracted their defamation, or until we get the tapes through litigation.&quot;</p>
<p>Comcast declined to respond to specific questions about O&#x2019;Rourke&#x2019;s case, with a company spokesman saying only that &quot;our customers deserve the best experience every time they interact with us. We have previously apologized to Mr. O&#x2019;Rourke, but we will review his lawyer&#x2019;s letter and respond as quickly as possible.&quot;</p>
<p>PWC spokeswoman Caroline Nolan did not respond to questions at the time of publication.</p>
<h2>&quot;Totally egregious&quot;</h2>
<p>In the months since his firing, O&#x2019;Rourke has discovered the numerous public complaints against Comcast&#x2014;which have only enraged him further.</p>
<p>&quot;I think they&apos;re totally egregious,&quot; O&#x2019;Rourke told Ars. &quot;I think they&apos;re the most unethical, dishonest bunch that I&apos;ve ever encountered. I would like to see them investigated for repeated overbilling. It is a very common occurrence.&quot;</p>
<p>In September 2014, he even went as far as sending a <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1309777-copy-of-blumenthal-as-sent-to-comcast.html"">10-page letter to Sen. Richard Blumenthal</a> (D-CT), detailing not only his story but articulating his deep concerns about Comcast&#x2019;s practices on a broader scale.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that they need to be made aware of how they conduct business, and, most importantly, I think that the consumer needs to be protected, and protection is not going to come in the form of them gobbling up somebody else [like Time Warner Cable],&quot; O&apos;Rourke said. &quot;That&apos;s not what&apos;s going to happen. If I was not able to convince AT&amp;T to provide service, I would be left without anything. I feel that they [Comcast] are a bully. They used their money to unfair advantage&#x2014;that is just absolutely wrong. There&apos;s a flagrant disregard for how they conduct themselves.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE, Wednesday Oct. 8:&#xA0;</strong>In an e-mail sent to Ars, PWC spokeswoman Nolan did not respond to specific questions but did send a statement. &quot;Mr. O&#x2019;Rourke was employed in one of our internal firm services offices,&quot; she wrote. &quot;The firm terminated his employment after an internal investigation concluded that Mr. O&#x2019;Rourke violated PwC&#x2019;s ethical standards and practices, applicable to all of our people. The firm has explicit policies regarding employee conduct, we train our people in those policies, and we enforce them. Mr. O&#x2019;Rourke&#x2019;s violation of these policies was the sole reason for his termination.&quot;</p>
<p>Later in the day, Comcast issued a <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/10/comcast-treatment-of-upset-former-customer-completely-unacceptable/"">public apology on its company blog</a>&#xA0;(written by&#xA0;Charlie Herrin, a company senior vice president). The company called its treatment of O&apos;Rourke &quot;completely unacceptable&quot; and noted, &quot;We also want to clarify that nobody at Comcast asked for him to be fired.&quot; O&apos;Rourke&apos;s lawyer Ryan responded to the statement, expressing disappointment at what her client viewed as a somewhat hollow apology. She reiterated that O&apos;Rourke&apos;s Oct. 14 deadline for Comcast to meet his demands&#x2014;or expect a lawsuit&#x2014;still stands.</p> </div>",arstechnica.com,,2335

                                <p>Many of today&#x2019;s modern customer service departments are notorious for leaving customers with anything but service. Phone calls lead to recorded run-arounds that resolve nothing while wasting the customer&#x2019;s time. If a live customer service representative is actually reached, they may cheerily declare a customer&#x2019;s problem solved, only for said customer to later find out that their problem is still alive and well. And sometimes companies have insulated themselves so well against customer complaints that the customer is simply left to pound sand.</p>
<p>But a company that will get you fired from your job for complaining to them? Ladies and Gentlemen, please welcome, Comcast!</p>
<p>While definitely not <a href=""http://www.inquisitr.com/1504720/comcast-home-security-customer-service/"">Comcast&#x2019;s</a> first trip to the bad customer service rodeo, this latest case may trump all others, with Comcast getting a guy named Conal fired from his company following ongoing problems he was having with Comcast, reports the <a href=""http://consumerist.com/2014/10/06/unhappy-customer-comcast-told-my-employer-about-complaint-got-me-fired/""><em>Consumerist</em></a>.</p>
<p>Conal, an employee with a prominent accounting firm, received wrong products, extra products he didn&#x2019;t request or need, wrong bills, and unwarranted bills &#x2013; in other words a virtual blizzard of frustrating gaffes by Comcast that he could not get resolved through Comcast customer service. So, he went above their heads to the Comcast powers that be, including their controller.</p>
<p>An unforeseen conflict that Conal didn&#x2019;t recognize, however, is that his company did business with Comcast. One of the higher ups at Comcast did see this though, and headed back over to Conal&#x2019;s employer apparently intent on turning Conal&#x2019;s complaints to Comcast against him.</p>
<p>This obviously influential Comcast executive had discussions about Conal with one of the partners in Conal&#x2019;s company, and Conal got the boot shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>Conal says he&#x2019;d only ever received positive reviews for his work, but the company claims he tried to use their name to get leverage in his dispute with Comcast. Conal maintains he did no such thing and can only surmise that someone from Comcast did some online sleuthing and figured out the connection with where he worked. This seemingly allowed Comcast to do some leveraging of their own to get Conal fired for daring to complain about their services.</p>
<p>In the end, Conal&#x2019;s employer says they fired him based on an email from Comcast that gave an overview of Conal&#x2019;s alleged wrongdoings via his interactions with Comcast employees.</p>
<p>Conal, meanwhile, says he&#x2019;s never been allowed to see that email to check its veracity, and Comcast won&#x2019;t release any documentation they have regarding his situation, either.</p>
<p>So, now stuck in a literal corporate nightmare, beneath both his own disloyal, former company and Comcast, Conal is left with little recourse, though he has retained a lawyer that has reportedly been in touch with Comcast.</p>
<p>The old adage about the customer always being right certainly doesn&#x2019;t seem to hold any water in Conal&#x2019;s dealings with Comcast.</p>
<p>But <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/man-claims-comcast-called-boss-112232265.html""><em>Business Insider</em></a> reports that, as also mentioned above, Conal isn&#x2019;t the first victim of Comcast&#x2019;s alleged less-than-stellar customer service.</p>
<p>Below, please enjoy some of Comcast&#x2019;s more well-known, documented, customer service fails.</p>

Yet, if reports this week are accurate, Comcast has continued to shine as an innovator in the competitive field of corporate terribleness: It got a customer&#x2019;s employer to fire him for complaining about shoddy customer service.</p><p>The <a href=""http://consumerist.com/2014/10/06/unhappy-customer-comcast-told-my-employer-about-complaint-got-me-fired/"">full story in all its sadistic glory is at <i>Consumerist</i></a>, but here&#x2019;s the SparkNotes version. A customer named &#x201C;Conal&#x201D; started subscribing to Comcast service in early 2013. There were issues: erroneous charges, bills that never arrived, discounts that weren&#x2019;t applied. Conal considered cancelling his service, but decided to stick with it after a Comcast rep promised that the issues would be resolved and threw in some free perks. As another friendly gesture, the company also allegedly sent and billed Conal for $1,820 of equipment he&#x2019;d never ordered.</p><div class=""module image-module module-image-650w366h""><div class=""module-content""><div class=""image-block image-650w366h""><div class=""image-frame""><img alt=""The Comcast Center in Philadelphia &#x2014; where the magic happens."" src=""http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/7d3a370d7b8f83876aabc33022279280"" width=""650""></div><p class=""caption""><span class=""caption-text"">The Comcast Center in Philadelphia &#x2014; where the magic happens.</span><span class=""image-source""><em>Source:</em>Getty Images</span></p></div></div></div><p>This is where it gets crazy. Conal, understandably frustrated, decided to bypass the customer service department and take his complaints straight to the Comcast controller. During the call, he claims, he suggested that a private-sector oversight group look into Comcast&#x2019;s billing and accounting issues. Shortly after that call, Comcast contacted Conal&#x2019;s employer &#x2014; a large accounting firm that <i>Consumerist </i>reports happened to do business with Comcast. The rep claimed that Conal had name-dropped his employer as leverage during the call; according to the story, the firm opened an investigation against Conal and then fired him from his job.</p><p>It&#x2019;s hard to know who&#x2019;s telling the truth here. Conal tells <i>Consumerist </i>that he never mentioned his employer and that someone at Comcast must have looked him up to figure out where he worked. Comcast, for its part, has allegedly refused to release any tapes of the phone calls it made on the matter. That&#x2019;s a little strange: If Conal did invoke his company&#x2019;s name in a threatening way, Comcast could easily prove as much by excerpting the relevant portion of his call.

In more bad PR for Comcast, the company allegedly got an unhappy customer fired from his job.</div><br>
</p>
<p><font class=""copyright_text_color_g""><b>Origins:</b></font> &#xA0; On <nobr>6 October</nobr> 2014, consumer advocacy blog <i>Consumerist</i></p>
<p>published an article in which former PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) employee Conal O&#x2019;Rourke alleged cable provider Comcast retaliated against him professionally over a business dispute. According to the blog and O&#x2019;Rourke, Comcast&#x2019;s interference led to the man&#x2019;s termination from the firm.</p>
<p>O&#x2019;Rourke gave a detailed timeline of his dealings with Comcast during the course of the post, explaining that he became a reluctant customer of the cable provider in early 2013. O&#x2019;Rourke admitted that his relationship with Comcast quickly degraded, leading to a series of adversarial interactions and a billing dispute with the provider.</p>
<p><i>Consumerist</i> quoted O&#x2019;Rourke&#x2019;s description of a &#x201C;bizarre&#x201D; call with a person he believed to be a Comcast rep. Shortly thereafter, O&#x2019;Rourke was fired from his job as described by the blog:</p>
<p><font class=""quote_font""><br>
<div class=""quote_style""><br>
At some point shortly after that call, someone from Comcast contacted a partner at the firm to discuss Conal. This led to an ethics investigation and Conal&#x2019;s subsequent dismissal from his job; a job where he says he&#x2019;d only received positive feedback and reviews for his work.</div></font></p>
<p>Comcast maintained that Conal used the name of his employer in an attempt to get leverage. Conal insists that he never mentioned his employer by name, but believes that someone in the Comcast Controller&#x2019;s office looked him up online and figured out where he worked.</p>
<p>When he was fired, Conal&#x2019;s employer explained that the reason for the dismissal was an <nobr>e-mail</nobr> from Comcast that summarized conversations between Conal and Comcast employees.<br>
</p></div><br> <p><i>Ars Technica</i> reached out to PwC for comment on the situation involving Comcast and Conal O&#x2019;Rourke, and PwC spokeswoman Caroline Nolan replied with a statement via <nobr>e-mail</nobr> that acknowledged O&#x2019;Rourke had been terminated over an ethics issue but provided no other details:</p>
<p><font class=""quote_font""><br>
<div class=""quote_style""><br>
Mr. O&#x2019;Rourke was employed in one of our internal firm services offices. The firm terminated his employment after an internal investigation concluded that <nobr>Mr. O&#x2019;Rourke</nobr> violated PwC&#x2019;s ethical standards and practices, applicable to all of our people. The firm has explicit policies regarding employee conduct, we train our people in those policies, and we enforce them. <nobr>Mr. O&#x2019;Rourke&#x2019;s</nobr> violation of these policies was the sole reason for his termination.<br>
</div><br>
</font></p>
<p>On 8 October 2014, Charlie Herrin, Senior Vice President of Customer Experience at Comcast Cable, issued a public apology to O&#x2019;Rourke in a post to <i><a href=""http://corporate.comcast.com/comcast-voices/a-public-apology-to-conal-orourke"">Comcast Voices</a></i>. In that statement, Herrin admitted to a lapse in customer service in the overall handling of O&#x2019;Rourke&#x2019;s issues but denied that anyone representing Comcast requested he be terminated from PwC. Herrin did resolve to investigate precisely how the entire situation escalated so severely:</p>
<p><font class=""quote_font""><br>
<div class=""quote_style""><br>
What happened with Mr. O&#x2019;Rourke&#x2019;s service is completely unacceptable. Despite our attempts to address <nobr>Mr. O&#x2019;Rourke&#x2019;s</nobr> issues, we simply dropped the ball and did not make things right. <nobr>Mr. O&#x2019;Rourke</nobr> deserves another apology from us and we&#x2019;re making this one publicly. We also want to clarify that nobody at Comcast asked for him to be fired.</div></font></p>
<p>We&#x2019;re also determined to get to the bottom of exactly what happened with his service, figure out what went wrong at every point along the way, and fix any underlying issues. I&#x2019;m a few weeks into a new role at Comcast which is entirely focused on what we can do to make the customer experience better. We need to make sure that every interaction is excellent from the moment a customer orders a new service, to the installation, to the way we communicate with them, to how we respond to any issues. </p>
<p>We&#x2019;re holding ourselves accountable and we are working hard to make real improvements across the board. While it will take us some time, we can and will do better than this.<br>

<p>A man says Comcast contacted his employer and got him fired after he called to complain about the company&apos;s service.&#xA0;</p> <p><a href=""http://consumerist.com/2014/10/06/unhappy-customer-comcast-told-my-employer-about-complaint-got-me-fired/"">The Consumerist reports that a man known as Conal complained to Comcast</a>&#xA0;after he was billed for services he didn&apos;t actually have. After Conal&apos;s complaint, the company promised him extra television channels as a make-good but instead sent him a variety of equipment he didn&apos;t need.&#xA0;</p> <p>Conal complained to Comcast again after he was billed $1,820 for the surplus hardware. This is where things get interesting. Conal, who says he works for a large American accountancy firm, compiled a spreadsheet showing every erroneous charge he had received from Comcast, which he sent to the company.</p> <p>Comcast then apparently refused to reverse the error, so in February 2014, Conal decided to try something else. Being an accountant, Conal contacted Comcast&apos;s comptroller, the office that looks after the company accounts. He said he repeatedly called them about his bill, telling them that Comcast should be investigated by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.</p> <p>The Consumerist says that after this, Comcast got in touch with Conal&apos;s employer.</p> <p>At some point shortly after that call, someone from Comcast contacted a partner at the firm to discuss Conal. This led to an ethics investigation and Conal&#x2019;s subsequent dismissal from his job; a job where he says he&#x2019;d only received positive feedback and reviews for his work.</p> <p><span>Comcast has released a public apology addressing Conal&apos;s account, commenting that what happened was &quot;completely unacceptable.&quot; <a href=""http://corporate.comcast.com/comcast-voices/a-public-apology-to-conal-orourke"">You can read the full statement here.</a></span></p> <p><span>After Conal&apos;s termination, his employer, the accounting company, said it had received an email from Comcast summarizing their conversations.&#xA0;</span></p> <p>It&apos;s alleged that Conal used the name of his employer during his calls with Comcast, a claim Conal denies. Instead, he says, someone working for Comcast researched him and discovered where he works. To make matters even more complicated, it&apos;s reported that the company Conal works for provides consulting services to Comcast.</p> <p>The &quot;<a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/former-comcast-employee-on-ryan-block-phone-call-2014-7"">lousy&#xA0;customer service from Comcast</a>&quot; story is becoming something of a media meme.

One <a href=""http://forums.macrumors.com/showpost.php?p=19884237&amp;postcount=8"">user</a> had all of his iWork documents wiped by using &quot;Reset All Settings,&quot; while other app information remained in iCloud.
<br>

<br>
In our own testing, using &quot;Reset All Settings&quot; deleted all iWork documents stored in iCloud Drive on the iPhone and on iCloud.com. After allowing time for syncing to a Mac running OS X Yosemite, all of the documents disappeared from that machine as well. Preview and TextEdit documents, which cannot be accessed on the iPhone, remained untouched on the Mac.
<br>

<br>
There appears to be no simple way to recover iCloud Drive documents that have been erased by &quot;Reset All Settings&quot; in Yosemite, and several people who have been affected by the bug are now in contact with Apple support in an effort to retrieve their documents. A <a href=""http://forums.macrumors.com/showpost.php?p=19880900&amp;postcount=1"">Mavericks user</a> was, however, able to recover his files from a backup folder, and OS X Yosemite users may also have luck with <a href=""http://forums.macrumors.com/showpost.php?p=19956866&amp;postcount=157"">recovering files via Time Machine</a>.

<br>
One user said that Apple was waiting on engineers to investigate the issue, while another said his account had been <a href=""http://forums.macrumors.com/showpost.php?p=19915227&amp;postcount=10"">placed</a> in troubleshooting mode to attempt to recover the data.

Introduced with iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite, <a href=""https://www.apple.com/ios/whats-new/icloud-drive/"">iCloud Drive</a> is Apple&apos;s answer to cloud-based storage services like Dropbox. iCloud Drive allows users to store a variety of documents like spreadsheets, PDFs, images, and more, accessing them on any device. Currently OS X Mavericks users can access iCloud Drive documents via iCloud.com, but iCloud Drive will be fully functional in October, after OS X Yosemite is released.
<br>

<br>
Users who have iCloud Drive enabled may want to refrain from using the &quot;Reset All Settings&quot; option on their devices for the time being, in order to avoid accidentally erasing important documents stored in iCloud Drive.</div>

  <p>If you&apos;re already using iOS 8&apos;s iCloud Drive feature, you might want to avoid your iPhone&apos;s &quot;Reset&quot; menu.&#xA0;<a href=""http://www.macrumors.com/2014/09/29/reset-all-settings-icloud-drive-bug/""><i>M</i><i>acRumors</i> reports</a> that a newly discovered bug causes iCloud Drive documents to be permanently erased from the cloud whenever a a user picks &quot;Reset All Settings.&quot; Ordinarily this option would simply do what it says; the iPhone&apos;s settings and preferences are immediately reset to their original factory defaults. No media (music, photos, etc.) or documents are supposed to be erased or otherwise affected when performing this action &#x2014; that should only happen if you choose &quot;Erase All Content and Settings&quot; and wipe your phone entirely.</p>


<p>But something&apos;s clearly not right, with <i>MacRumors</i> reporting that documents stored in iCloud Drive are disappearing from Apple&apos;s iWork apps upon reset. They&apos;re also vanishing from OS X Yosemite, which will bring iCloud Drive to Mac users later this fall. Right now, it&apos;s iOS users along with Yosemite developers and beta testers reporting the problem. iCloud Drive is also&#xA0;<a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/19/6508795/icloud-drive-for-pcs-before-macs"">available on Windows</a>, but it&apos;s unclear if the issue has popped up there. It&apos;s also not yet obvious how widespread the bug is or whether it affects everyone that has transitioned to iCloud Drive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In our own testing, using &quot;Reset All Settings&quot; deleted all iWork documents stored in iCloud Drive on the iPhone and on iCloud.com. After allowing time for syncing to a Mac running OS X Yosemite, all of the documents disappeared from that machine as well. Preview and TextEdit documents, which cannot be accessed on the iPhone, remained untouched on the Mac.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There&apos;s no easy way of recovering documents deleted from iCloud. Apple added a &quot;recently deleted&quot; folder to Photos in iOS 8, but hasn&apos;t yet implemented a similar option for all of iCloud. MacRumors notes the issue &quot;may be limited to Apple&apos;s own iWork apps like Pages, Keynote, and Numbers&quot; and iCloud Drive files from other third-party apps could be safe from the bug. But for now, the best option is avoiding &quot;Reset All Settings&quot; entirely until a fix is in place. We&apos;ve reached out to Apple for clarification on just what&apos;s going on.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Apple, things aren&apos;t looking much better this week, as <em>MacRumors</em> reports on a particularly nasty iOS 8 bug, which could potentially erase the iWork documents stored in your iCloud drive. </p> <p>According to the <a href=""http://www.macrumors.com/2014/09/29/reset-all-settings-icloud-drive-bug/"">report</a>, the option to &quot;Reset All Settings,&quot; found under Settings &#x2014; General &#x2014; Reset in iOS 8, also deletes documents from the iCloud Drive &#x2014; permanently. </p>
<p>The option, which normally resets settings to factory defaults, clearly states that &quot;no data or media will be deleted.&quot; However, after some users on <a href=""http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1787223""><em>MacRumors</em>&apos; forum</a> complained about the bug, MacRumors tested the option out, and indeed, all the iWork documents stored in iCloud Drive both on the iPhone and on iCloud.com were gone. </p>
<p>Even worse, after iCloud synced with a Mac running OS X Yosemite, the documents were deleted from the Mac as well. Some of the documents &#x2014; including Preview and TextEdit files &#x2014; were untouched, but all iWork files seem to be affected. </p>
<p>In some scenarios it&apos;s possible to retrieve these files from a backup folder, or via Time Machine, but nothing is certain at this point, and Apple still hasn&apos;t publicly acknowledged the bug. For now, iOS 8 users who have iCloud Drive enabled should probably avoid using the &quot;Reset All Settings&quot; option.</p> </section>",mashable.com,,1

It could delete files stored in the cloud.<br>

<p><span id=""ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-159"" class=""ezoic-adpicker-ad""></span><span id=""ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617"" class=""ezoic-adpicker-ad""></span>The bug was <a href=""http://www.macrumors.com/2014/09/29/reset-all-settings-icloud-drive-bug/"">discovered by MacRumors</a>, who found that selecting the &#x201C;Reset All Settings&#x201D; option from Settings in iOS 8 will erase iWork-related files in iCloud Drive. </p>
<p>This is not the way it&#x2019;s supposed to work. When you reset an iPhone or iPad&#x2019;s settings, iOS will even tell you that no data or media will be deleted. But in iOS 8, this isn&#x2019;t working as intended.</p>
<p>The good news is if you don&#x2019;t use iWork, you don&#x2019;t have anything to fear: The deleted files bug seems to be specific to iWork documents. But you should still probably stay clear of the &#x201C;Reset All Settings&#x201D; option until Apple gets this sorted out. Better safe than sorry.</p>

As discovered by <em>MacRumors</em>, the issue <a href=""http://www.macrumors.com/2014/09/29/reset-all-settings-icloud-drive-bug/"">presents itself</a> when iPhone and iPad users attempt to reset preferences via the device&apos;s Settings &gt; General &gt; Reset &gt; Reset All Settings option. The feature allows users to troubleshoot possible iOS issues by reverting all system settings back to factory baselines.</p>
As OS X 10.10 Yosemite, and subsequently iCloud Drive, is not yet available for consumer download aside from Apple&apos;s public beta testing program, the effects on consumers are non-existent. However, with a large number of untrained public beta participants opting in to the service with iOS 8, the problem could become serious. According to the report, one iPad user performed the reset and found his local iWork documents deleted, which consequently wiped those same documents from the cloud when the tablet synced to iCloud. It appears only data from first-party apps connected to iCloud Drive are affected by the bug, though not all users are seeing the issue play out as described. In some cases, files are being delete upon syncing with iCloud, while other data remains untouched. It is suggested that users back up iCloud Drive documents to a local computer prior to performing the Reset All Settings operation.
iCloud Drive is Apple&apos;s solution to cloud storage, syncing and collaboration. The system allows seamless file transport and storage across iOS, OS X and Windows, while enabling advanced features like document editing, asset tagging and drag-and-drop data management.<p>
Apple will activate iCloud Drive alongside the release of OS X Yosemite later this fall, bringing the company&apos;s The feature has already rolled out to beta testers, as well as the iCloud.com <a href=""http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/09/10/apple-adds-icloud-drive-and-settings-to-icloudcom-beta-webpage"">beta website</a>, which now supports access and editing of stored documents. </p><br></div> </div> </div>",,,325

Last week, security research Stefan Esser noted that QuickType was offering up his unique passwords as autocorrect suggestions, and now <a href=""http://www.macrumors.com/2014/09/29/reset-all-settings-icloud-drive-bug/""><em>MacRumors</em> forum users are reporting</a> that the &#x2018;Reset All Settings&#x2019; feature on <a href=""http://bgr.com/tag/ios-8"">iOS 8</a> is deleting iWork documents from the newly-implemented <a href=""http://bgr.com/tag/icloud-drive"">iCloud Drive</a> service.<span id=""more-3853870""></span></p>

<p>One third-generation iPad user was less than satisfied with the performance of their tablet after updating to iOS 8. In order to fix the problem, they decided to reset all the settings on their iPad, which, according to the text box, should&#xA0;restore the default settings but leave data and media&#xA0;intact. Instead, all of the iWork data disappeared on both the tablet and within iCloud Drive.</p> <p><em>MacRumors</em> attempted to recreate the scenario and recorded the same results: files from Apple&#x2019;s iWork apps, such as Numbers, Page and Keynote, vanished shortly after the settings had been reset. Other files, such as Preview and TextEdit documents, were still accessible.</p>
<p>If you were considering activating iCloud Drive, it might be worth waiting until Apple has time to address this issue. Although it only seems to be affecting iWork apps, users have only just begun to explore the less-than-functional elements of the new software.&#xA0;iOS 8.0.3 might be needed&#xA0;sooner than Apple had planned.</p> <div class=""entry-tags""> Tags: <a href=""http://bgr.com/tag/apple/"">Apple</a>, <a href=""http://bgr.com/tag/icloud/"">iCloud</a>, <a href=""http://bgr.com/tag/icloud-drive/"">iCloud Drive</a>, <a href=""http://bgr.com/tag/ios-8/"">iOS 8</a> </div> </div>",bgr.com,,266

Apple&apos;s new mobile operating system has been riddled with problems since Day One, and the latest issue may be one of its most insidious. Users have discovered that by resetting an iOS 8 device&apos;s user preferences to the defaults, their iCloud files may disappear as well.</p> <p>Disgruntled iOS 8 users have gathered at the <a href=""http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1787223"">MacRumors</a> forums to swap war stories, and the issue seems fairly widespread. iPad 3 owner Chris Newbold complained of slow load times on iOS 8, but when he chose &quot;Reset All Settings&quot; (not a factory reset, which wipes all user data from a device) to address the issue, he found that all of his iWork data had disappeared, even though iOS 8 assured him at the beginning of the process that it would not delete any data or media.</p> <p><strong>MORE: <a href=""https://www.tomsguide.com/us/iphone-6-ios-8-problems,news-19611.html"">All the iPhone 6 (and iOS 8) Fails to Date</a></strong></p> <p>Newbold was hardly alone: As the thread continued, other users reported the same phenomenon, and had varying degrees of success recovering their files. Some were able to use Apple&apos;s Time Machine software to roll back the clock and restore their cloud files, but others found that the bug wiped out even the backups.</p> <p><a href=""http://www.macrumors.com/2014/09/29/reset-all-settings-icloud-drive-bug/"">MacRumors tested</a> the phenomenon itself and was able to confirm Newbold&apos;s findings. Reset All Settings does indeed wipe out users&apos; cloud files, and as soon as the phone syncs with their computers, recovering them via Time Machine is difficult, too.</p> <p>For the time being, Apple has not officially addressed the issue, so don&apos;t reset your iOS 8 device unless you have all your files backed up somewhere other than iCloud. If you&apos;ve already undergone the process and lost your files, some users have had good luck after contacting Apple Support.

http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/22/apple-plans-to-shut-down-beats-music/,Apple Plans To Shut Down Beats Music,Josh Constine,2014-09-22T00:00:00.000Z,"<div><div class=""article-entry text""> <img src=""https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/beatsmusic-shutterstock_132921989-1.jpg?w=738"" class="""">
<p id=""speakable-summary"">Apple will discontinue the streaming music service Beats Music it acquired in May, according to five sources, including several prominent employees at Apple and Beats. Many engineers from Beats Music have already been moved off the product and onto other projects at Apple, including iTunes. It&#x2019;s not clear when exactly Jimmy Iovine and Dr Dre&#x2019;s music service will be shut down or what Apple will do with streaming, but every source with knowledge of the situation that we talked to agreed Apple plans to sunset the Beats Music brand.</p>
<p>[<strong>Update</strong>: Apple has told TechCrunch&#xA0;that our report of Beats being shut down &#x201C;is not true&#x201D;,&#xA0;but sources familiar with the situation tell <a href=""http://recode.net/2014/09/22/apples-beats-music-brand-may-go-away-apples-beats-music-service-is-sticking-around/"">Re/code</a> that Apple &#x201C;may, however, modify [Beats Music] over time, and one of those changes could involved changing the Beats Music&#xA0;brand.&#x201D; This aligns with what my sources said, which is that the Beats Music brand will be shut down, but that it&#x2019;s unclear what Apple wants to do in streaming music. It seems quite possible that the Beats Music product could be rolled into iTunes rather than being &#x2018;shuttered&#x2019;, but that&#x2019;s semantics.</p>
<p>Apple&#x2019;s response&#xA0;really depends on the interpretation of &#x201C;shut down&#x201D;. If Apple rolls Beats Music into iTunes and removes the dedicated Beats Music app from the App Store, I would call that being shut down. Beats Music itself came from a &#x201C;rebranding&#x201D; aka shutdown of the MOG music streaming service it acquired. We&#x2019;ll see what happens if and when Apple adds streaming to iTunes, but its doubtful that Apple will maintain Beats Music as its own brand and independent product.]</p>
<p>The fact that the new iPhones did not come pre-installed with Beats Music, while several other Apple apps <a href=""http://www.imore.com/yes-iwork-apps-are-pre-installed-64gb-and-128gb-iphone-6-and-iphone-6-plus"">came loaded</a> on the 6 and 6 Plus, should have been a red flag. There was also nothing said about Beats Music during the Apple Watch reveal, even though the service&#x2019;s radio and fire-and-forget playlists could work well on a wearable. In August, Beats Music was <a href=""http://9to5mac.com/2014/08/12/apple-prominently-advertising-beats-music-to-new-ios-device-users/"">being advertised to new users</a> on iOS 7, yet the only time Beats Music got an off-hand mention at the September launch event was when Apple CEO Tim Cook said the new U2 album would be available there.</p>
<p>Instead of Beats Music, the Apple Watch features a <del>unannounced music app</del> [Update: Remote app] with a blue play button (top right in the photo below) that instantly started playing songs when tapped during a demo.</p>

<p>Considering Apple&#x2019;s penchant for simple, unified brands, and how it despises fragmentation, shutting down Beats Music makes a lot of sense. Running a second music service in parallel with iTunes that forces people to learn a whole new interface might have confused customers. Beats Music&#x2019;s CEO <a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/08/01/with-apple-beats-deal-complete-ian-rogers-to-run-itunes-radio/"">Ian Rogers was also put in charge of iTunes Radio</a>, meaning he&#x2019;s already splitting his time rather than just focusing on Beats Music.</p>
<p>Shutting down Beats Music also meshes with reports that the Beats acquisition was <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-05-29/apple-beats-deal-headphones-cool-factor-talent"">mostly about</a> getting Jimmy Iovine and <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/22/apples-beats-deal-is-happening-and-its-a-dre-acquihire/"">Dr. Dre&#x2019;s</a> talent on board, and picking up the headphone business, not about streaming music. Having Beats as a side brand in music accessories flows naturally, but seems clumsy when it comes to software. We&#x2019;ve contacted Apple with a request for comment on its plans for Beat Music. [Update: Response in update above.]</p>

<p>Beats Music&#x2019;s growth has likely been hampered by its late start compared to competitors like Spotify, Rdio, Google Music, and Pandora. Though its strategy was to differentiate itself through curated playlists and mood-based radio, those failed to capture the attention of mainstream listeners. Thanks to seven-day free trials and multi-month demos through AT&amp;T, 5&#xA0;million people had tried Beats by May, but only 250,000 had signed up for a paid subscription. That&#x2019;s pretty small compared to the 10 million paid subscribers and 40 million total listeners on Spotify, and&#xA0;<a href=""http://investor.pandora.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=227956&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1951104&amp;highlight="">76.4 million</a>&#xA0;active listeners on Pandora. Yet stacked up against the iTunes userbase, Beats Music is just a drop in the bucket for Apple. Apple certainly didn&#x2019;t hesitate to shut down music streaming service Lala after acquiring it.</p>
<p>The big question is what will Apple do with streaming music. Buying Beats Music may still assist Apple hear through talent, technology, and industry relationships even without the Beats Music brand.</p>
<p>One source said Apple may roll streaming into iTunes. This could be the most logical strategy for&#xA0;Apple if it can find a way to keep its traditional music file download customers happy while opening its catalogue to streaming for early adopters who want to listen from the cloud. Perhaps rather than just buy buttons, there could be play buttons in iTunes, too. Another source said Apple plans to make some significant music announcement in the first half of next year.</p>

<p>Apple is in the tricky position of trying to <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/28/a-smooth-transition-from-music-sales-to-streaming/"">smoothly transition its music business</a> from the download to the streaming era. Digital music sales fell 13.3 percent in 2013, while U.S. streaming grew 32 percent. With <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/03/streaming-is-killing-downloads/"">streaming eating downloads</a>, Apple will have to make a shift or at least accomodate streaming. But it doesn&#x2019;t just want to ditch sales overnight. 1.26 billion songs and 117.6 million albums were sold online in 2013, providing <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/22/bridging-the-download-and-cloud-music-eras/"">vital capital to the music industry</a>.</p>
<p>Forcing users across the chasm from iTunes to Beats Music seems precarious, especially with on-demand streaming competitors like Spotify and Google Music looking to pounce on potential customers. It&#x2019;s doubtful that Apple would abandon its iTunes brand after 13 years of success just because Beats joined the family. Evolving a unified Apple music service sounds a lot better than having two playing out of sync.</p>

          <div class=""content""><img class=""alignright size-full wp-image-410810"" src=""http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2014/05/beats.png"" alt=""beats"" width=""175"">Apple is planning to discontinue Beats Music, the streaming music service that it acquired as part of an acquisition of Beats Electronics back in May. According to <em><a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/22/apple-plans-to-shut-down-beats-music"">TechCrunch</a></em>, multiple sources that include &quot;several prominent employees at Apple and Beats&quot; have confirmed that Apple is shutting down the music service.<blockquote>Many engineers from Beats Music have already been moved off the product and onto other projects at Apple, including iTunes. It&apos;s not clear when exactly Jimmy Iovine and Dr Dre&apos;s music service will be shut down or what Apple will do with streaming, but every source with knowledge of the situation that we talked to agreed Apple plans to sunset the Beats Music brand.</blockquote>Apple first acquired Beats Music in May, and at the time, announced plans to leave the music service untouched. There were no plans to integrate Beats Music into iTunes, with the company suggesting that it would remain as a standalone service.
<br>

<br>
<em>TechCrunch</em> suggests that the fact that Beats Music did not come pre-loaded onto the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus serves as a &quot;red flag&quot; that the music service is on its way out. The site also pointed towards an Apple Watch demo that included an &quot;unannounced music app with a blue play button that instantly started playing songs when tapped during a demo,&quot; but that icon appears to correspond to the <a href=""http://appshopper.com/entertainment/remote"">Remote app</a> and not a new music app.
<br>

<br>
Apple shutting down Beats Music is unusual news given the efforts that the company has gone to in order to promote it in recent weeks, adding it to the list of &quot;<a href=""http://www.macrumors.com/2014/08/15/beats-music-apps-by-apple/"">Apps Made by Apple</a>&quot; and recommending the app to new iOS users. If Apple plans to do away with Beats Music, it is unclear what further moves it will make in the streaming music arena. Beats Music was seen as the company&apos;s answer to popular services like Spotify, aimed at bolstering flagging music sales.
<br>

<br>
According to one source who spoke to <em>TechCrunch</em>, Apple might be planning to roll streaming music into iTunes, creating a unified Apple music service after shutting down Beats Music.
<br>

<br>
<b>Update:</b> According to an Apple representative that spoke to <a href=""http://recode.net/2014/09/22/apples-beats-music-brand-may-go-away-apples-beats-music-service-is-sticking-around/""><em>Re/code</em></a>, the company is not planning to shut down Beats Music.<blockquote>So why would Apple plan to shut down Beats Music, as a TechCrunch headline reports?
<br>
Answer: It&apos;s not.
<br>

<br>
Tom Neumayr, says the TechCrunch story is &quot;not true&quot;, but wouldn&#x2019;t elaborate.</blockquote>While the spokesperson declined to elaborate, <em>Re/code</em> suggests that while Apple does not plan to shut down Beats Music, it may &quot;modify it over time,&quot; changing the brand name.<br><br></div>

</p> <p> Apple spokesman&#xA0;Tom Neumayr said rumors of Beats Music&apos;s shuttering were &quot;not true&quot; <a href=""http://recode.net/2014/09/22/apples-beats-music-brand-may-go-away-apples-beats-music-service-is-sticking-around/""> in a statement to Re/code&apos;s Peter Kafka</a>. However, Kafka adds that Beats Music may be rebranded in the future.
</p> <p> Beats Music is similar to Spotify, Rdio, and other streaming music services. You pay $10 a month for unlimited access to songs from all the major record labels. The service was one of the key reasons Apple bought Beats Electronics for $3 billion earlier this year. Beats also makes popular headphones and other audio accessories.
</p> <p> It&apos;s more likely that Apple will take the Beats Music technology and incorporate it into iTunes or iTunes Radio. Shutting it down wouldn&apos;t make any sense, especially considering Apple CEO Tim Cook <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-on-why-apple-bought-beats-2014-9""> recently told Charlie Rose</a> that he was so impressed with Beats Music that he &quot;couldn&apos;t sleep&quot; after listening to it for the first time. That doesn&apos;t sound like a product Cook would want to kill off.
</p> <p> Beats Music also has a neat feature that Apple might want to incorporate into future products. &quot;The sentence&quot; gives users the opportunity to select music based on their activity or location (think &quot;I&apos;m on a boat&quot; or &quot;I&apos;m on a rooftop and feel like going back in time&quot;).
</p> <p> Here&apos;s what Beats Music looks like on the iPhone:

The blog&apos;s Josh Constine says that he&apos;s confirmed the news with five sources at both Apple and Beats. And to be honest, it makes sense. </p><p>(<em>Update:</em> Apple <a href=""http://recode.net/2014/09/22/apples-beats-music-brand-may-go-away-apples-beats-music-service-is-sticking-around/"">told Re/Code</a> that the TechCrunch story is &quot;not true&quot; but did not deny that the company could fold Beats Music into iTunes.)</p><p>It seems very unlikely that Apple is going to abandon streaming music altogether. If true, news that Beats Music is dying reads as a clear indication that Apple is going to create its own streaming service or simply expand iTunes Radio. Constine <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/22/apple-plans-to-shut-down-beats-music/"">agrees</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Considering Apple&apos;s penchant for simple, unified brands, and how it despises fragmentation, shutting down Beats Music makes a lot of sense.

People thought the company&apos;s music app for wearables would be Beats Music. And maybe it sort of is on the back end! It just won&apos;t be called Beats Music. </p><p>After the news broke, Apple&apos;s Tom Neumayr told Re/Code&apos;s Peter Kafka that the TechCrunch story was &quot;not true.&quot; Kafka, however, elaborates that Apple &quot;may, however, modify it over time, and one of those changes could involved changing the Beats Music brand.&quot; That does not rule out the idea that Beats Music could be rolled into iTunes, which is what many analysts have thought would happen since the acquisition. Regardless, it seems like something is up. We&apos;ll have to wait and see exactly what that something is.

  <p>Beats Music will eventually disappear as a brand,&#xA0;<a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/22/apple-plans-to-shut-down-beats-music/"">according to a new report</a>. <i>TechCrunch</i> reports that Apple plans to eliminate the Beats Music streaming service, which&#xA0;<a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2014/5/28/5700530/apple-confirms-beats-acquisition"">it acquired in May</a>, but doesn&apos;t say when. The report is less clear on what Apple plans to do with streaming music. One source tells TechCrunch that on-demand music could be integrated into iTunes; another source says Apple will make a &quot;significant music announcement&quot; in the first half of 2015.</p>


 

<p>Engineers from Beats Music have already been transferred to other divisions at Apple, including iTunes, according to the report. As <i>TechCrunch</i> notes, Beats Music CEO Ian Rogers was&#xA0;<a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/08/01/with-apple-beats-deal-complete-ian-rogers-to-run-itunes-radio/"">put in charge of Apple&apos;s ad-supported iTunes Radio</a> product in August and has been splitting his time between the services since then.</p>
<p><q class=""center"">&quot;The first music subscription service done right&quot;</q></p>
<p>When Apple bought the Beats brand for $3 billion, Apple senior vice president Eddy Cue called Beats Music &quot;<a href=""http://live.theverge.com/apple-beats-eddy-cue-jimmy-iovine-codecon/"">the first music subscription service done right</a>.&quot; Though it mostly mimicked existing services from Spotify, Rdio, and others, Beats Music tried to differentiate itself through hand-curated playlists and the involvement of music-industry titans like Dr. Dre and Trent Reznor. But after three months it had only 250,000 subscribers, compared to&#xA0;<a href=""https://press.spotify.com/us/information/"">over 10 million</a> on Spotify. Still, Cue had positioned Beats as a key component of Apple&apos;s music strategy, saying that the company wanted to offer on-demand listening along with ad-supported radio and digital downloads.</p>
<p>All of which suggests that while the Beats Music brand may be going away, on-demand streaming from Apple could easily take another form. If iTunes is remade as a kind of celestial jukebox that combines your MP3s and on-demand streaming into a single place, the Beats Music brand going away might not be such a bad thing, after all.</p>


<p>Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>


<p><b>Update, 4:43 p.m.</b>: An Apple spokesman tells <i>Recode</i> that TechCrunch&apos;s report is &quot;<a href=""http://recode.net/2014/09/22/apples-beats-music-brand-may-go-away-apples-beats-music-service-is-sticking-around/"">not true</a>,&quot; though he won&apos;t elaborate. <i>Recode</i> says Apple plans to continue to offer on-demand streaming but may &quot;modify&quot; the Beats Music brand over time, suggesting it may fold the service into iTunes.</p>

Apple's Beats Music Service Is Sticking Around.,,2014-09-22T18:41:28.000Z,"<div><div class=""c-entry-content c-entry-content__legacy""> <p>Earlier this year, <a href=""http://recode.net/2014/05/28/apple-buys-beats-for-3-billion/"">Apple bought Beats Music and Beats Electronics for $3 billion</a>. Since then, CEO <a href=""http://recode.net/2014/05/28/tim-cook-explains-why-apple-is-buying-beats-qa/"">Tim Cook has gone out of his way to rave about the Beats Music subscription service</a>, which sells all-you-can-eat music for $10 a month.</p> <p>So why would Apple plan to shut down Beats Music, as a TechCrunch headline <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/22/apple-plans-to-shut-down-beats-music/"">reports</a>?</p>
<p>Answer: It&#x2019;s not.</p>
<p>Tom Neumayr, Apple&#x2019;s PR rep, says the TechCrunch story is &#x201C;not true&#x201D; but wouldn&#x2019;t go beyond that.</p>
<p>I can elaborate a bit more, based on conversations with people familiar with Apple&#x2019;s thinking: Apple won&#x2019;t shutter the streaming service. It may, however, modify it over time, and one of those changes could involved changing the Beats Music&#xA0;brand.</p> <p>Note that Apple does seem pretty pleased with the iTunes brand, which was the focus of its <a href=""http://recode.net/2014/09/11/the-internet-wants-to-know-where-to-return-apples-gift/"">controversial U2 album giveaway</a> this month.</p>
<p>Shuttering the Beats Music brand name makes some sense, as the company hadn&#x2019;t generated a ton of traction before Apple bought it in May &#x2014; at that time, it only had a few hundred thousand subscribers. On the other hand, the Beats headphone brand, which Apple doesn&#x2019;t have any plans to dump, does have a lot of recognition, so it would seem bizarre to dump that.</p>

As noted by <em>MacRumors</em>, AT&amp;T has <a href=""http://www.macrumors.com/2014/10/15/att-stops-offering-beats-subscriptions/"">abruptly stopped</a> selling Beats Music subscriptions to its customers and is has taken down access to a free trial period previously open to all comers. The option to subscribe via AT&amp;T has also been removed from Beats Music&apos;s own webpage. </p><p>
An AT&amp;T spokesperson offered further clarification to <em>AppleInsider</em>, saying only that the policy shift does not affect those customers currently enrolled in a Beats Music family plan or the service&apos;s trial period. </p>
&quot;There haven&apos;t been any changes for AT&amp;T customers who currently have the Beats Music family plan or who are within their free trial period,&quot; the spokesperson said. &quot;New subscribers can still get Beats Music through their app store or at beatsmusic.com.&quot; <p>
Before Beats Music debuted <a href=""http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/01/21/beats-music-subscription-internet-radio-service-launches-with-ios-app"">in January</a>, the company inked an exclusive deal with AT&amp;T to sell subscriptions as part of bundled cellular plans. Under certain contract terms, like the above mentioned family plan, customers were able to bill Beats Music to their wireless bill and share the service with up to five family members.</p><p>
No information was provided as to the change in availability, though Apple is rumored to be working on new options for the streaming music service. The company <a href=""http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/09/22/apple-reportedly-planning-to-shut-down-beats-music-subscription-streaming-service"">denied reports</a> from September saying Beats Music would be shuttered and rolled into iTunes Radio, but left open the possibility of rebranding.</p></div> </div> </div>",,,274

If true, the move would be a change from May, when Apple <a href=""http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/05/28/apple-emphasizes-acquisition-of-beats-music-service-in-blockbuster-announcement"">emphasized Beats Music</a> as a key component of its $3 billion purchase of the headphone maker. The Beats Music product received top billing over Beats Electronics in Apple&apos;s press release announcing the deal, even though the headphone making side of the business is the brand&apos;s most recognizable role.</p><p>
Observers also believed that the Beats Music service allowed Apple to enter a <a href=""http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/05/29/wall-street-warming-up-to-3b-apple-beats-deal-sees-potential-to-offset-declining-itunes-revenue"">key subscription market</a> where the iTunes Store and iTunes Radio do not compete. Sales of digital albums have been declining in recent years as customers have migrated to competing services like Spotify and Pandora.</p><p>
But Beats Music also got off to a <a href=""http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/05/13/beats-music-had-110k-subscribers-in-march-with-impressive-free-to-paid-conversion"">slow start</a>, with just 110,000 subscribers as of March. Its performance since being acquired by Apple remains unknown.</p><div><div class=""article-img""><img src=""http://photos2.insidercdn.com/v9/images/1x1-white.jpg"" alt="""" class=""lazy lazy""></div><br><span class=""minor2 small gray"">Source: <a href=""http://www.beatsmusic.com/"">Beats Music</a></span></div><p>
The rumor would suggest that Apple&apos;s $3 billion buyout of Beats was really about the headphones side of the business, as well as the <a href=""http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/05/22/apple-wants-beats-for-jimmy-iovine-and-dr-dre-not-technology"">talent and credibility</a> brought on by the &quot;acqui-hires&quot; of Beats&apos;s Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre.</p>
Iovine is a longtime music industry executive and was a personal friend of late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. Both he and Dr. Dre have considerable sway in the industry and could help secure content for Apple&apos;s iTunes business.<p>
When it was announced earlier this year, Apple&apos;s $3 billion buyout of Beats proved controversial, with critics suggesting that the iPhone maker had overpaid for a company better known for its brand than quality products. But proponents believe the addition of Beats products to Apple&apos;s portfolio will help the company earn revenue from a lucrative accessories market where the company did not previously compete.</p></div>",,,425

<p>According to <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/22/apple-plans-to-shut-down-beats-music/"">a report published by TechCrunch</a>, <a href=""http://variety.com/t/apple/"" id=""auto-tag_apple"">Apple</a> has begun to wind down the streaming music service that it acquired in May, with many of its staffers already moved onto other projects at Apple. <a href=""http://variety.com/t/itunes/"" id=""auto-tag_itunes"">ITunes</a> is said to be one of them.</p>
<p>Beats Music CEO Ian Rogers already has been put in charge of iTunes Radio, with the Beats Music technology likely to be integrated into that service, sources say.</p>
<p>Beats Music has not been heavily promoted during Apple&#x2019;s recent product demonstrations, including the launch of its new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, as well as its Apple Watch.</p>
<p>In fact, the new smartphones do not include Beats Music pre-loaded as an app &#x2014; an unusual move and sign that Apple has other plans for Beats Music&#x2019; technology. U2&#x2019;s free album was offered through Beats Music.</p> <p>While the Apple Watch, out next year, will include a music app, Beats Music wasn&#x2019;t mentioned during its launch demo.</p>
<p>The confusion two separate music services could generate among consumers is said to be one of the reasons Apple is making the move to close Beats Music. Apple also had shut down another streaming service, Lala, after acquiring it.</p>
<p>While Apple isn&#x2019;t expected to entirely do away with Beats Music, the company is rethinking whether to still operate it as a separate brand, sources <a href=""http://recode.net/2014/09/22/apples-beats-music-brand-may-go-away-apples-beats-music-service-is-sticking-around/"">also confirmed to Re/Code</a>.</p>
<p>While Beats Music has the Beats headphone brand helping put it in the spotlight, the service has struggled to compete against more established online players like Spotify, Pandora, Rdio and Google Music.</p>
<p>It had just 111,000 paying subscribers in March, and 250,000 in May, according to Jimmy Iovine. That&#x2019;s compared to 10 million for Spotify.</p>
<p>Beats Music was part of the $3 billion purchase of Beats Electronics Apple made in August.</p>

<p>Apple said it had no official plans to &#x201C;shutter&#x201D; the service, but did not provide more details on how it might be used in the future.</p>
<p>Apple is having to take a close look at its iTunes business as digital music sales fell 13.3% in 2013, whereas streaming grew 32% last year in the U.S.</p> </div>",variety.com,,369

<p><a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-shutting-down-beats-music-2014-9"">Business Insider</a> predicts that the Beats Music streaming service will be absorbed into the larger iTunes ecosystem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s more likely that Apple will take the Beats Music technology and incorporate it into iTunes and/or iTunes Radio. Apple CEO Tim Cook recently told Charlie Rose that he was so impressed with Beats Music that he &#x201C;couldn&#x2019;t sleep&#x201D; after listening to it for the first time. That doesn&#x2019;t sound like a product Cook would want to completely kill off.</p>
<p>Beats Music also has a neat feature that Apple might want to incorporate into future products. &#x201C;The sentence&#x201D; gives users the opportunity to select music based on their activity or location (think &#x201C;I&#x2019;m on a boat&#x201D; or &#x201C;I&#x2019;m on a rooftop and feel like going back in time&#x201D;).&#x201D;</p>

<p>Apple&#x2019;s other big announcement in the first half of 2015 will be the official release date of the Apple Watch. Perhaps the Apple Watch will be involved in Apple&#x2019;s next music project in some way, though it is too early to say so with any degree of certainty. </p>

<p><a href=""http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/09/17/beats-music-comes-to-apple-tv-alongside-flat-user-interface-ios-8-integrations"">Apple Insider</a> notes that a Beats Music app was just added to the Apple TV interface on September 17, making the plans for a Beats Music shutdown seem even more surprising. It does seem odd that Apple would add Beats to the Apple TV one week, and then start shutting down the service a week later. It&#x2019;s fair to assume that if the rumors are true, and Apple is killing Beats Music, it won&#x2019;t shut down the service overnight.<br>

http://www.macrumors.com/2014/10/15/att-stops-offering-beats-subscriptions/,AT&T No Longer Offering Beats Music Subscriptions to Customers,Juli Clover,2014-10-15T20:18:00.000Z,"<div><div class=""article"">
          
          
          <div class=""content"">AT&amp;T is no longer offering Beats Music subscriptions to its subscribers as an add-on service, according to an AT&amp;T employee who spoke to <em>MacRumors.</em> The cellular company has ceased giving customers the option to sign up for Beats Music when purchasing a new phone plan and the <a href=""http://www.beatsmusic.com/pricing"">Beats Music website</a> has been updated to remove its &quot;Subscribe with AT&amp;T&quot; options.
<br>

<br>
AT&amp;T employees have also been instructed to stop selling Beats Music subscriptions to customers, suggesting the partnership between Beats Music and AT&amp;T has come to an end following Apple&apos;s Beats acquisition.
<br>

<br>
<img src=""http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2014/10/attsubscribe.jpg"" alt=""attsubscribe"" width=""500"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-425613""><center><em>AT&amp;T subscription options <a href=""http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:pddZVd0mdsYJ:www.beatsmusic.com/pricing+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us"">formerly offered</a> on the Beats Music Pricing page</em></center>
<br>
Beats Music and AT&amp;T first struck an <a href=""http://www.fiercewireless.com/story/att-partners-beats-streaming-music-service/2014-01-13"">exclusive deal</a> shortly before the service&apos;s initial debut, with AT&amp;T offering multiple Beats Music subscription options, including a family pack that allowed users to share Beats Music with up to five family members. AT&amp;T also offered extended trial periods of up to 90 days and promoted the music service to customers both online and in-store.
<br>

<br>
It&apos;s likely the deal between Beats Music and AT&amp;T has ended due to Apple&apos;s <a href=""http://www.macrumors.com/2014/05/28/apple-buys-beats/"">$3 billion purchase</a> of both Beats Music and Beats Electronics in May, but it is unclear why AT&amp;T has been able to continue to offer Beats Music subscriptions up until October.
<br>

<br>
Rumors have suggested that Apple has plans to <a href=""http://www.macrumors.com/2014/09/22/apple-shutting-down-beats-music/"">rebrand Beats Music</a>, and its upcoming retooling may also be the reason behind the dissolution of the AT&amp;T partnership. Along with changing the Beats Music name, Apple is said to be planning to introduce new features and it is also hoping to offer the service at a lower cost, asking music labels <a href=""http://www.macrumors.com/2014/10/02/apple-labels-streaming-cut/"">to cut their rates</a>.
<br>

<br>
It is unknown when Apple plans to reveal its revamped music service, but rumors have hinted that its debut could come <a href=""http://www.macrumors.com/2014/09/23/apple-february-revamp-beats-music/"">alongside the 2015 Grammy Awards</a> in February, which means that Apple engineers and designers are likely already hard at work on the rebranding.
<br>

<br>
<b>Update</b>: Reached for comment, an AT&amp;T spokesman gave the following statement:<blockquote>There haven&#x2019;t been any changes for AT&amp;T customers who currently have the Beats Music family plan or who are within their free trial period. New subscribers can still get Beats Music through their app store or at beatsmusic.com.</blockquote></div>

http://pando.com/2014/09/09/source-apple-set-to-acquire-path-in-an-attempt-to-bolster-ios-social-cred/,Source: Apple set to acquire Path in an attempt to bolster iOS social cred,"Michael Carney , written on September 9, 2014",2014-09-10T03:20:00.000Z,"<div class=""contains-copy full""> <p>In a day packed with major Apple announcements, the company tackled smartphones, <a href=""http://pando.com/2014/09/09/the-apple-watch-could-be-worth-all-of-the-hyperbole-and-still-fail-terribly/"">wearables</a>, and <a href=""http://pando.com/2014/09/09/heres-why-applepay-will-majorly-shake-up-consumer-payments-landscape-even-if-it-gets-lost-amid-the-iphone-and-applewatch-frenzy/"">payments</a>. But there is one more sector that may be about to get the Apple treatment: Social.</p>
<p>According to a single well-placed source inside Apple&#x2019;s engineering team, the company is poised to announce an acquisition of Dave Morin&#x2019;s Path social network. To quote our source, who requested to remain anonymous because the deal has not been announced yet, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s almost done, if not signed already, but it&#x2019;s essentially a done deal.&#x201D;</p>
<p>If true, it would be major news for the heretofore <a href=""http://pando.com/2014/05/22/paths-kiss-of-death-compliment-its-hugely-popular-in-indonesia/"">struggling social platform</a> that has been known more for its design and user interface innovations than for its ability to drive adoption among consumers &#x2013; particularly in non-Asian markets. Apple hasn&#x2019;t fared much better in the social realm historically, having flopped with its Ping social network and having made very little out of its acquisition of the team and IP from failed location-based photo social network, Color.</p>
<p>According to our source, this is more than just a talent acquisition, or acquihire. The Path product will likely survive the acquisition and be incorporated, in whole or in part, into Apple&#x2019;s newly refreshed Messages app. That doesn&#x2019;t mean that the deal will be priced like some other recent high-profile mobile communication deals, namely Facebook&#x2019;s $19 billion Whatsapp acquisition and rumored $3 billion-plus offers extended to Snapchat by Facebook and Google.</p>
<p>Facebook paid $42 per Whatsapp user, and $33 per Instagram user before that. By comparison, Rakuten bought the far less beloved Viber for just $3 per user. With Path having somewhere in the vicinity of 25 million users at the beginning of this year, and far weaker growth and engagement than any of the above platforms, it would be lucky to command&#xA0;anywhere near Instagram/Whatsapp sums. According to App Annie, <a href=""http://www.appannie.com/apps/ios/app/403639508/app-ranking/#device=iphone&amp;daily=2014-09-08&amp;type=ranks"">Path ranks just 177th</a> among iOS Social Networking apps in the US and not among the top 1000 overall iOS apps. When Path raised its most recent round in January of this year, the company reportedly commanded a sub-$400 million valuation, well below the $500 million-plus levels reportedly sought by management. Given the trajectory it was on, exiting at that level would likely be considered a win among most Path insiders. Hell, for many Valley observers, that would be the win of the century for Path investors, many of which have all but left the company for dead.</p>
<p>Apple&#x2019;s re-entry into social would also be a notable development. With Facebook (including Instagram and Whatsapp), Twitter, and Snapchat each looking stronger than ever in their respective social verticals, it&#x2019;s unclear just where an Apple-driven social product would fit in among consumers daily habits. Google seems to have reached a similar conclusion, all but abandoning its strategy of pushing Google+ as a standalone social platform, and instead choosing to let the platform fade into the background of its other consumers platforms like Gmail and YouTube. Apple&#x2019;s one stronghold has been in messaging via iMessage, which recently got a facelift. And Path has recently leaned more in this direction with its launch of an ephemeral messaging product, abandoning its long-held <a href=""http://pando.com/2014/06/12/paths-dave-morin-gives-up-on-lasting-memories/"">love&#xA0;of&#xA0;more lasting, intimate communications</a>. It&#x2019;s certainly conceivable that Path could be integrated into Apple&apos;s messaging&#xA0;platform, but it&#x2019;s unclear, beyond the design prowess, how this acquisition helps Apple, at any price.</p>
<p>Adding additional fuel to this fire, Dave Morin was spotted sitting in the front row for today&#x2019;s Apple keynote event, a high profile position reserved for Dr. Dre and other key Apple insiders.
<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"">Did not forget about Dre. <a href=""http://t.co/fWNDpFhfYr"">pic.twitter.com/fWNDpFhfYr</a></blockquote></p>
<p>&#x2014; Dave Morin (@davemorin) <a href=""https://twitter.com/davemorin/status/509388253099601921"">September 9, 2014</a>
Apple has been known to be a fan of Morin&#x2019;s, as well as the Path design aesthetic and broader design team. Take for example the company&#x2019;s decision to feature the Path app early on in numerous keynotes and advertising campaigns. In that sense, it wouldn&#x2019;t be that surprising if such a deal were to be consummated. <a href=""http://blog.launch.co/blog/apple-knocks-it-out-of-the-park-will-be-first-trillion-dolla.html"">Jason Calacanis</a> made a similar observation in his evening email newsletter today, noting Morin&#x2019;s seating at today&#x2019;s event and Apple&#x2019;s long-standing frustrations around social. Others have been asking <a href=""http://www.quora.com/Should-Apple-acquire-Path"">whether such an acquisition makes sense</a> for years.</p>
<p>To be clear, even if our source is correct, these transactions&#xA0;are never a sure thing until ink has been put to paper and (at least in the case of a public company like Apple) a public announcement has been made. But the tea leaves seem to be aligning on this deal. It&apos;s certainly an unexpected outcome, but it would sound even more crazy if Apple didn&#x2019;t have north of $150 billion in cash burning a hole in its pocket and a love for all things aesthetic. And with Morin&apos;s vaunted reputation for design, and Apple&apos;s social struggles I can&apos;t think of a better home for the once-hyped app.&#xA0;Don&#x2019;t be surprised to see Apple swoop in to rescue Path from social also-ran status.</p>

But do not despair, fair founders! There are plenty of reasons why this deal is just business as usual in Silicon Valley and not the end of days.</p><p>
1. Friends Buying Friends<br>
Acquisitions tend to be chummy affair. For example, Path CEO Dave Morin invested in Hot Potato, a company run by <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150610573053034&amp;set=bc.AbrauFIa-AjJmVnXKS8ZooTkJFET3NSJyuYd32IkK_22dEsHjvxz1JOjDqzju4XW4YZrf6uAo5lKTnBju-tL6m0pdGHYojAc5rJAP-zCLrPi458IzMojZuSKoKEVwQUIZRe5w8Cpl2IiVfT_eSl7GqdJtZ4M_iWAFgpTif7SXcMAAg&amp;type=1&amp;opaqueCursor=Abp2KUaPV0DxvY_lsC0O1xjlKaJkEPfGTrX_SpPNEkDo8pmV4piIdgUVoSSRM8oJtX2ck19FwYIPbrgrVYPX8k4rIB5myVsE37WVzQeJ1W_4kHKznUOyv9RenCBP6zGaLNECyG9_2SBA7c1L_YJz-e303jesphAfj9tuTAgBTRhn8dWwdoqU-h-AP3wHU_KkD2j2BxjX6zLLkHp5Ah577icbrKe5YEcbHVX4F7HgmE5O3w&amp;theater"">his ski buddy</a> Justin Shaffer, Morin worked for Facebook, Facebook <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/28/facebook-to-pay-10-million-cash-for-hot-potato-says-source/"">acquired</a> Hot Potato. Karma, another Morin investment, was also acquired by Facebook. And Dave started his career at Apple <a href=""http://www.designerfounders.com/interviews/dave-morin-path/"">helping give out iPods</a> on college campuses. See, all in the family. </p><p>
2. Buying Cool<br>Apple, which has $150 billion in cash, has been proven itself willing to <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/articles/apple-to-buy-beats-1401308971"">buy new fans before</a> with the Beats acquisition. <em>But Path is the opposite of cool</em>, you say. That is true, but Morin has proven himself to be a savvy and <a href=""https://angel.co/syndicates"">popular angel investor</a>. In the interest of succession planning, a source told Valleywag, why wouldn&apos;t Apple let Morin rest and vest if it meant young CEOs dropping by Cupertino? &quot;He&apos;s a good exec, he&apos;s just a sub-par product person. He did well at Apple and Facebook because they had good products,&quot; added the source.</p><aside class=""link-preview""><a href=""http://online.wsj.com/articles/apple-to-buy-beats-1401308971""><p>Apple said it is buying Beats Electronics for $3 billion to bolster a music business that has lost&#x2026;</p></a></aside><p>
3. Messaging Mania<br>Silicon Valley corporations got smoked by Asian messaging apps. People like to communicate with their friends, who knew? <a href=""http://pando.com/2014/09/09/source-apple-set-to-acquire-path-in-an-attempt-to-bolster-ios-social-cred/"">Pando says</a> that&apos;s part of Apple&apos;s renewed interest in social:</p><blockquote><p>According to our source, this is more than just a talent acquisition, or acquihire. The Path product will likely survive the acquisition and be incorporated, in whole or in part, into Apple&apos;s newly refreshed Messages app. That doesn&apos;t mean that the deal will be priced like some other recent high-profile mobile communication deals, namely Facebook&apos;s $19 billion Whatsapp acquisition and rumored $3 billion-plus offers extended to Snapchat by Facebook and Google.</p><p>Facebook paid $42 per Whatsapp user, and $33 per Instagram user before that. By comparison, Rakuten bought the far less beloved Viber for just $3 per user. </p></blockquote><p>Perhaps we&apos;ll hear more about the price tag when Morin <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/events/disrupt-sf-2014/agenda/"">takes the stage</a> at TechCrunch Disrupt in less than an hour. </p><p>4. No One Even Expects Acquisitions to Succeed<br>Selling out <a href=""http://www.thebolditalic.com/articles/5674-the-unexpected-bummers-of-getting-acquired"">can be a bummer</a> not just for those in golden handcuffs, but for the buyers, says Pando:</p><aside class=""link-preview""><a href=""http://www.thebolditalic.com/articles/5674-the-unexpected-bummers-of-getting-acquired""></a></aside><blockquote><p>Apple hasn&apos;t fared much better in the social realm historically, having flopped with its Ping social network and having made very little out of its acquisition of the team and IP from failed location-based photo social network, Color.</p></blockquote><p>There, feel better?</p><p>

With the Beats buy they get real streaming, an exec team with a VERY strong pipeline into the music industry, and an service already finished that is very &quot;Apple.&quot; Also the CEO of Beats Music was already long time buds with product line manager of iTunes due to their shared experience at WinAmp, so in a way it is like getting the band back together. </p><p>I don&apos;t know why they want Path, but if they want a &quot;social network&quot;, they suck at building stuff like this and Path is probably the only social service still for sale. </p> </div> </div><div id=""reply1633057681"" class=""reply reply--nested""> <p class=""reply__likes""> 5 </p> <div class=""reply__body""> <p>From a business perspective, Beats is a juggernaut.

</p> <p> So what will Apple be getting when it acquires Path? Here&apos;s a guide.
</p> <h3> Path Is A Private Social Network
</h3> <p> One of Path&apos;s most unique features is just how much power it gives users over who can see their posts. Users are limited to just 150 friends, with no option to share posts publicly.
</p> <p> <span class=""KonaFilter image-container display-table image on-image""> <img src=""http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/54102aab69bedd5c14c92c15-539-524/img_3876.jpg"" alt=""Path screenshot""> <span class=""source-only source"">Path</span> </span> </p> <p> As well as sharing posts to their friends, Path users can also create an &quot;Inner Circle&quot; of friends who can see their most private posts.
</p> <p> <span class=""KonaFilter image-container display-table image on-image""> <img src=""http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/54102a58ecad04a312123b38-547-644/img_3881-4.jpg"" alt=""Path screenshot showing the Inner Circle function""> <span class=""source-only source"">Path</span> </span> </p> <h3> Polished Design
</h3> <p> <span class=""KonaFilter image-container display-table image on-image""> <img src=""http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/54101cb569beddcd58c92c13-640-960/img_3878-2.jpg"" alt=""Patch screenshot showing design elements""> <span class=""source-only source"">Path</span> </span> </p> <p> Path is often praised for its design, with Apple even featuring the social network in keynote slides. The app includes minimalist navigation icons and clock hands that spin as you scroll through the timeline.
</p> <h3> The New Ping?
</h3> <p> Apple&apos;s short-lived iTunes Ping service allowed users to share the music they were listening to, as well as keep track of famous musicians. Shuttered two years after its launch, the app failed to gain a significant number of users.
</p> <p> <span class=""KonaFilter image-container display-table image on-image""> <img src=""http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/541022b76bb3f72b27123b2a-640-526/img_3880-1.jpg"" alt=""Path screenshot showing U2 song music post""> <span class=""source-only source"">Path</span> </span> </p> <p> But a major feature of Path is very similar to Apple&apos;s Ping service. The app offers the ability to share what music you&apos;re listening to with friends.
</p> <h3> It Lets You Share What Time You Go To Sleep
</h3> <p> One of Path&apos;s more unique features is the ability to share what times you go to sleep and wake up. Tap the sleep button, and Path will ask you whether you&apos;re conscious or not.
</p> <p> <span class=""KonaFilter image-container display-table image""> <img src=""http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/5410247f6da8113c26100140-640-333/img_3886-2.jpg"" alt=""Patch screenshot""> <span class=""source-only source"">Path</span> </span> </p> <p> Select &quot;Go to Sleep&quot; and the app shows a night sky and a moon to get you in the mood.

</h3> <p> Path&apos;s latest update was the launch of a new messaging app in June. Path Talk lets you messages your Path friends, as well as share a whole load of information about yourself through the app.&#xA0;
</p> <p> <span class=""KonaFilter image-container display-table image on-image""> <img src=""http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/54102985ecad04ab16123b2a-640-743/img_3890-1.jpg"" alt=""Path Talk screenshot""> <span class=""source-only source"">Path</span> </span> </p> <p> As well as sensing when you&apos;re traveling on trains and in cars, the app can also continually broadcast your battery level.

</h3> <p> Currently, Path earns money by selling virtual stickers and photo filters.

http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/09/10/rumor-apple-in-talks-to-buy-messaging-app-path,Rumor: Apple in late-stage talks to buy Path social platform,"AppleInsider Staff Tuesday, September 09, 2014, 10:46 pm PT (01:46 am ET)",,"<div><span class=""article-leader"">According to a report late Tuesday, Apple is on the verge of announcing an acquisition of social network and corresponding app Path, possibly in a bid to restart a branded platform after the failure of Ping. <br></span><br><div><a href=""http://appleinsider.com/l/?link=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/path/id403639508?mt=8""><div class=""article-img""><img src=""http://photos2.insidercdn.com/v9/images/1x1-white.jpg"" alt=""snoop"" class=""lazy lazy""></div></a></div><p>
As reported by <em>Pando Daily</em>, a source with knowledge of the matter claims <a href=""http://pando.com/2014/09/09/source-apple-set-to-acquire-path-in-an-attempt-to-bolster-ios-social-cred/"">an agreement</a> between Apple and <a href=""http://appleinsider.com/l/?link=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/path/id403639508?mt=8"">Path</a> is &quot;essentially a done deal.&quot; The publication cites one person currently working for Apple in unnamed engineering department.</p><p>
Interestingly, the source says Apple is looking to keep Path intact following the rumored buyout, a tactic that strays from the company&apos;s usual M&amp;A tactics. Save for the recent acquisition <a href=""http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/05/28/apple-buys-beats-electronics-for-3-billion-iovine-and-young-to-join-company"">of Beats</a>, Apple usually performs so-called &quot;acquihires,&quot; or purchases made for talent, not a brand name. The publication speculates that Path may make its way into iOS Messages. </p>
Path, which has been frequently featured in the iOS App Store, is not unlike a mobile-only version of Facebook. Users can share photos, videos, audio messages, and thoughts with their friends, who can reply with fine-grained emotions &#x2014; friends can express shock at a post, for instance, or &quot;love&quot; rather than simply &quot;liking&quot; the content. In addition, Path users can simultaneously share &quot;moments&quot; with their other social networks, putting Path at the middle of their social sharing endeavors.<p>
The company has also recently spun off its in-app messaging feature as a standalone app called <a href=""http://appleinsider.com/l/?link=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/path-talk/id867760913?mt=8""><em>Path Talk</em></a>, which competes with &quot;over the top&quot; messenger apps like WhatsApp and Kik.</p><p><em>Pando Daily</em> also points out that Path cofounder Dave Morin was seen sitting in the front row at Flint Center for Tuesday&apos;s iPhone 6 keynote. Apple saves those seats for high-ranking executives and special guests. For example, during the presentation, Jony Ive was seen sitting with design superstar and <a href=""http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/09/05/apple-hires-designer-marc-newson-will-assist-jony-ive-on-"">new Apple employee</a> Marc Newson.</p>
Pricing went unmentioned, but the struggling social networking firm&apos;s recent round of funding reportedly clocked in at a sub-$400 million valuation, much less than a rumored $500 million valuation sought by executives. Further, Path is not a high-ranking title in the iOS App Store and currently sits below the top-1,000 downloaded apps.<p>
Aside from being one of the less popular social networking services, Path had a few missteps that drew scrutiny from governmental regulatory agencies and even Apple itself. In 2012, the firm was <a href=""http://appleinsider.com/articles/12/02/07/path_app_under_fire_for_unauthorized_address_book_upload.html"">dinged</a> for uploading users&apos; address books without permission, claiming the automated action was meant to more easily find other friends using the app. The issue snowballed into a U.S. Federal Trade Commission investigation, which was ultimately settled for $800,000 in early 2013. </p><p>
On the day Path&apos;s settlement, a researcher discover a flaw in the app&apos;s backend that <a href=""http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/02/01/path-found-to-geotag-uploaded-photos-without-user-consent-fix-coming-soon"">geotagged</a> photos uploaded by users. The problem was quickly patched, but shortly thereafter Path <a href=""http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/04/30/path-app-again-accused-of-unacceptable-address-book-access"">was again accused</a> of unacceptable contacts handling techniques. </p></div>",,,455

          <div class=""body"">Apple is said to be close to acquiring social network Path in an attempt to boost the company&apos;s social media efforts, <a href=""http://pando.com/2014/09/09/source-apple-set-to-acquire-path-in-an-attempt-to-bolster-ios-social-cred/"">reports</a> <em>PandoDaily</em>. Citing a &quot;well-placed&quot; source inside Apple&apos;s engineering team, the site notes that the deal is &quot;essentially a done deal&quot; and would see Apple integrating Path&apos;s current services into its Messages app.

<br>
Additionally, Path founder Dave Morin was seen sitting in the front row for today&apos;s special media event, which is usually reserved for high ranking executives at the company. Throughout the past few years, Apple has also featured Path in a number of its earlier advertising campaigns and keynotes for the iPhone. 
<br>

<br>
However, the social networking service caused a fair amount of controversy in 2012 when it was discovered to be uploading users&apos; entire address books to its servers without alerting users or asking for authorization. The issue <a href=""http://www.macrumors.com/2013/02/01/path-reaches-settlement-with-ftc-over-address-book-privacy-concerns/"">prompted an investigation</a> by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission as Morin was even <a href=""http://www.macrumors.com/2012/03/15/tim-cook-met-with-paths-dave-morin-over-address-book-debacle/"">summoned</a> to Apple&apos;s Cupertino headquarters to be grilled by CEO Tim Cook and other executives.
<br>

<br>
Path&apos;s last major development came in June when the company <a href=""http://blog.path.com/post/89363839677/introducing-talk"">announced</a> that it would be launching its own separate messaging app, complete with quick reply capabilities and Apple Maps integration.</div>

Apple has previously stumbled in this arena with a music-centric social network called Ping that went largely unused and was discontinued in 2012. So it makes sense that it might want to start with someone else&apos;s (quite functional and flashy looking) foundation to bring a native social experience to its iOS devices.</p><p>Path was founded in 2010 by ex-Facebooker Morin and Napster co-founder Shawn Fanning. In five rounds of funding to date, the company&#xA0;<a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/path"">has received $77 million in investments</a> from <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/path/investors"">40 different investors</a>.</p><p>Path was originally conceived as a companion network to Facebook for people to enjoy higher engagement with a smaller number of quality friends and contacts. It specifically limited users to 150 in-network connections as a tip of the hat <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number"">to Dunbar&apos;s number</a>, an idea in anthropology stating human brain size is such that we can only support meaningful relationships with 150 people. Where Facebook would be a place for wishing distant acquaintances a noncommittal happy birthday, Path would be specifically for sincere communications with your smaller, closer circle of friends and family.</p><p>The company released its app first on iPhone, later following up with apps for Android, Windows Phone and iPad. While it only <a href=""http://gizmodo.com/ping-redux-apple-is-reportedly-buying-private-social-1632849129"">boasts 25 million users</a>&#xA0;(a far cry from the userbase of social giants like Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat), the app is quite glamorous-looking and loaded with simple visual appeal. You might consider its news feed a list of stylized Facebook updates from people you actually want to hear from.</p><p> <span class=""figure image""> <picture width=""600"" height=""450"" class=""mapping-embed""><source srcset=""http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/embed/public/2014/09/10/path-screenshot.jpeg 1x""><source srcset=""http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/embed-md/public/2014/09/10/path-screenshot.jpeg 1x""><source srcset=""http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/embed-md/public/2014/09/10/path-screenshot.jpeg 1x""><source srcset=""http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/embed-md/public/2014/09/10/path-screenshot.jpeg 1x""><source srcset=""http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/embed-sm/public/2014/09/10/path-screenshot.jpeg 1x""><img width=""600"" class=""mapping-embed"" src=""http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/embed/public/2014/09/10/path-screenshot.jpeg"" alt=""path screenshot""></picture><meta><meta><meta> <span class=""figcaption""> <span class=""caption"">A screenshot of the Path iPad app.</span> <span class=""credit"">Photo: Path</span> </span> </span></p><p>Apple and Path already have history together. Not only is Path&apos;s Morin a former Apple employee who worked in the company&apos;s marketing and product division from 2004-2006, but Path also made a fairly major error surrounding iOS user privacy in 2012. Its app uploaded iPhone users&apos;&#xA0;<a href=""http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2399970,00.asp"">complete contact lists to its servers</a>, which led to&#xA0;<a href=""http://9to5mac.com/2012/02/15/congress-presses-apples-cook-to-come-clean-on-ios-developer-data-access-following-path-address-book-debacle/"">Apple CEO Tim Cook responding to letters from the U.S. Congress</a>&#xA0;about how Apple responds to user privacy. A&#xA0;second privacy flub in 2013 saw Path pay an $800,000 penalty to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission for storing information belonging to underage users; it agreed to independent privacy assessments every other year for the next 20 years.</p><p>Path has had its problems, but its product -- a walled garden for more-intimate socialization with your closest friends -- is strong and functional.</p><p>Apple has yet to build a social experience people want to use habitually, so this acquisition would be a sensible one. If and when it becomes official, we&apos;ll be standing by for the specifics.</p></div>",www.ibtimes.com,,537

Today, on stage at TechCrunch Disrupt, Path founder Dave Morin was <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/10/path-apple-watch/"">asked</a> about the report.</p>
<p>Morin&apos;s response was straight from the Dummies Guide To Media Training:&#xA0;&#x201C;We don&#x2019;t comment on rumors or speculation.&#x201D; When TechCrunch&apos;s Matthew&#xA0;Panzarino pointed out&#xA0;&#x201C;that&#x2019;s not a no,&#x201D; Morin repeated his response.</p>
<p>There are a couple of things to note here. For one thing, from a PR point of view, Morin&apos;s response was exactly right. If the deal is about to happen, then he&apos;s hardly going to confirm it on stage to a reporter ahead of time. If the deal isn&apos;t about to happen, Morin can still benefit from the idea that Path is still valuable to <em>someone</em>.</p>
<p>And yet, it&apos;s interesting&#xA0;how Morin&apos;s&#xA0;&quot;no comment&quot; flies in the face of a promise he made to Pando&apos;s Sarah Lacy last year about how he and Path would deal with the press in future. As Sarah <a href=""http://pando.com/2013/08/15/heres-why-path-didnt-leak-a-fake-valuation-and-you-shouldnt-either/"">explained at the time</a>:
<blockquote>I explained the problem from the journalists&#x2019; side, and asked Morin what he proposed for a publication and entrepreneurs who want to start having a fairer dialog. Not a favorable one, but a fair one. Something that helps readers more than the denial, the reporter speculation, and the rewritten press release.</blockquote></p>
<p>He said for his part he was no longer going to obfuscate anything. If a reporter gets a scoop, and it&#x2019;s accurate and he or she calls him up, he&#x2019;ll say congratulations and tell them to run with it. No more playing games.
Given Morin&apos;s response on stage today, and the fact Carney contacted him&#xA0;last night for comment but received no response, perhaps a more accurate promise would have been &quot;No more playing games, unless I&apos;m&#xA0;scared shitless of upsetting Apple.&quot;</p> </div></div>",,,310

Perhaps to satiate our need to be digitally social, Apple is reportedly close to purchasing the nearly four-year-old Path. Insiders say the deal may already be done, too.</p> <p><br>
According to Pando Daily, one well-placed source on Apple&#x2019;s Engineering squad says <em>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s almost done, if not signed already, but it&#x2019;s essentially a done deal.&#x201D;</em> So why is Apple interested in Path, if they indeed are? In a way, they&#x2019;re kindred.</p>
<p>Path struggles to find users, but that&#x2019;s obviously not why they and Apple are so similar. If anything positive can be said of Path, it&#x2019;s with their design. They&#x2019;ve been widely lauded as a heavy-hitter when it comes to UI and experience, something Apple covets in their own right.</p>

<p>Further evidence of this comes with news that Dave Morin &#x2014; current Path CEO and former Apple employee &#x2014; was spotted sitting front and center at Apple&#x2019;s iPhone 6/Apple Watch event yesterday. That&#x2019;s a spot typically reserved for top brass and partners, not the CEO if a hit-and-miss social platform Apple has no involvement in.</p>
<p>Apple snapping up Path is also said to be more than an acquihire to get folks like Morin back in the fold. Pando&#x2019;s source says Path will survive the acquisition whole, and be cobbled (somehow, maybe lightly) into Apple&#x2019;s revamped Messaging app.</p>
<p>It seems a likely acquisition, and it will be interesting to see how Apple works Path into their fold. Path is good, but suffers the same &#x201C;ghost town&#x201D; moniker that haunts other social platforms like Google+. But hey, at least it will probably work out better than <a href=""https://www.slashgear.com/apple-to-shutter-ping-in-next-itunes-release-13233749/"">Apple&#x2019;s previous social experiment</a>, right?</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ibm"" class=""u-underline"">IBM</a> has issued a strong rebuke to a report that it is preparing to cut more than a quarter of its global workforce.</p>
<p>A US technology blogger claimed <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertcringely/2015/01/22/next-weeks-bloodbath-at-ibm-wont-fix-the-real-problem/"" class=""u-underline""> on Forbes.com</a> that the US technology giant was about to announce plans to slash 110,000 jobs under a scheme known internally as Project Chrome.</p>
<p>&#x201C;To fix its business problems and speed up its &#x2018;transformation&#x2019; &#x2026; about 26% of IBM&#x2019;s employees will be getting phone calls from their managers. A few hours later a package will appear on their doorsteps with all the paperwork. Project Chrome will hit many of the worldwide services operations,&#x201D; wrote Robert Cringely wrote, claiming that the dismissals will take place by the end of next month.</p>
<p>IBM said it did not comment on &#x201C;ridiculous&#x201D; speculation, but strongly suggested it was inaccurate.</p>
<p>&#x201C;IBM does not comment on rumors, even ridiculous or baseless ones,&#x201D; the company said. &#x201C;If anyone had checked information readily available from our public earnings statements, or had simply asked us, they would know that IBM has already announced the company has just taken a $600m charge for workforce rebalancing. This equates to several thousand people, a small fraction of what&#x2019;s been reported.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Last week, Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter told investors on IBM&#x2019;s fourth-quarter earnings conference call that the company was taking restructuring charges of around $580m (&#xA3;384m), but he did not specify the number of jobs affected.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We are not going to replicate the same level of restructuring that we had last year,&#x201D; Schroeter said in response to a Wall Street analyst&#x2019;s question. &#x201C;It will be a lower amount.&#x201D;</p>
<p>IBM&#x2019;s fortunes contrast starkly with those of rival Apple, which is expected to unveil bumper sales of its iPhones and desktop computers on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Known as Big Blue for its once-ubiquitous corporate logo, IBM struggled to make the transition from manufacturing computers and microchips to the world of cloud computing. <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/20/us-ibm-results-idUSKBN0KT2FY20150120"" class=""u-underline"">Last week, Ginni Rometty, chief executive since 2012, reported quarterly profits below analysts&#x2019; forecasts</a> and an 11th straight quarter of falling revenues.</p>
<p>Annual revenue fell to $93bn (&#xA3;62bn) last year from $107bn three years earlier as the company shed businesses <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/20/ibm-pay-globalfoundries-microchip-microelectronics-business"" class=""u-underline"">such as its unprofitable chip design and manufacturing arm</a>. IBM, once an industry pioneer, is still the world&#x2019;s biggest computer technology company, but it has failed to produce income from consulting, security software and analytics to make up for declining revenues from its old operations.</p>
<p>The company last year scrapped a $20-a-share earnings target. The goal was set in 2010, shortly before Warren Buffett decided to invest $10bn in IBM.</p>

<p>IBM is in the process of layoffs, as disclosed in its latest earnings report last week, but they will affect &#x201C;several thousand&#x201D; employees only, according to an emailed statement from IBM to Reuters.</p>
<blockquote><p>IBM does not comment on rumors, even ridiculous or baseless ones</p></blockquote>
<p><a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertcringely/2015/01/22/next-weeks-bloodbath-at-ibm-wont-fix-the-real-problem/"">A report last Thursday on Forbes&#x2019; website</a></p>
<p> by pseudonymous Silicon Valley technology gossip columnist Robert Cringely said IBM planned to lay off 26% of its 430,000-strong global workforce, or as many as 112,000 employees.</p>
<p>IBM did not issue a categorical denial of the report, but strongly suggested it was inaccurate.</p> <p>&#x201C;IBM does not comment on rumors, even ridiculous or baseless ones,&#x201D; the company said in the email. &#x201C;If anyone had checked information readily available from our public earnings statements, or had simply asked us, they would know that IBM has already announced the company has just taken a $600 million charge for workforce rebalancing. This equates to several thousand people, a small fraction of what&#x2019;s been reported.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Last week, Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter told investors on IBM&#x2019;s fourth-quarter earnings conference call that the company was taking restructuring charges of around $580 million, but he did not specify the number of jobs affected.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We are not going to replicate the same level of restructuring that we had last year,&#x201D; Schroeter said in response to a Wall Street analyst&#x2019;s question. &#x201C;It will be a lower amount.&#x201D;</p>
<p>IBM&#x2019;s shares were up about 0.8% at $157.28 on the New York Stock Exchange after paring earlier gains.</p>

If that figure holds true, that would make it far and away the largest corporate layoff event in history, breaking the record previously held by IBM, when it cut 60,000 in 1993.</p><p>The <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertcringely/2015/01/22/next-weeks-bloodbath-at-ibm-wont-fix-the-real-problem/"">report</a> comes from long-time Silicon Valley journalist Robert X. Cringely, who recently published an eBook on IBM&apos;s issues entitled <a href=""http://www.cringely.com/2014/06/04/decline-fall-ibm/"">The Decline and Fall of IBM</a>. He blamed past CEOs Louis Gerstner and Sam Palmisano for making the mess and current CEO Virginia Rometty has done nothing to address them.</p><aside class=""nativo-promo smartphone"" id=""""> </aside><p>The problem is a complex stew of bad management &#x2013; like laying off important people in the middle of a project &#x2013; to <a href=""http://www.itworld.com/article/2700750/big-data/ibm-s-watson-loses-its-head.html"">unrealistic expectations</a> from commercializing Watson and failing to adjust to the new era. The &quot;M&quot; in IBM may mean machines, but hardware is less than 10% of its business. Two-thirds of its business is in services, and the services pipeline has dried up.</p><p>Why? Well, according to an ex-IBMer I spoke to some time ago, who confirmed what Cringely wrote in his book, IBM is still wedded to services contracts in an age where companies are shutting down their internal data center entirely and moving everything to the cloud. If you don&apos;t have a data center, you don&apos;t need an IBM service contract to manage it.</p><p>That&apos;s why <a href=""http://www.itworld.com/article/2711254/cloud-computing/what-is-softlayer--and-what-did-ibm--emc-and-at-t-see-in-them-.html"">IBM grabbed Softlayer</a>, the cloud services provider. It needed to get into the cloud fast because it was behind Microsoft, Google and Amazon. Since the purchase 18 months ago, IBM has put a huge amount of money into SoftLayer and there has been a number of announcements around SoftLayer services.</p><p>Cringely said the mainframe and storage areas will see deep cuts, which would be counterproductive considering IBM announced the new Z13 mainframe and hopes it will stimulate sales. That won&apos;t be easy when you cut the people who are supposed to sell it. Cutting storage in the era of Big Data and Data Lakes, where storage is vital to these concepts, also seems shortsighted.</p><aside class=""nativo-promo tablet desktop"" id=""""> </aside><p>And you have to wonder what a layoff of 110,000 people will do to the firm. That has to be jarring. I remember an old advertisement from the print days that said &quot;What&apos;s worse, getting laid off on a Friday or being told to pick up the slack on the following Monday?&quot; This will be undeniably upsetting to the survivors.</p><p>The question I have to ask is why isn&apos;t Rometty one of the 110k. IBM has seen 11 straight quarters of declining revenue and it&apos;s hemorrhaging customers, according to both my source and Cringely. It&apos;s becoming apparent she is not up for the job and can&apos;t pull the company out of its nose dive.</p><p>Cringely said the layoffs will begin next week and by the end of February, all of the employees will be gone. If nothing else, IBM&apos;s first quarter numbers will take a monstrous hit from the severance packages for 111,000 employees. To say nothing of what this will do to its customer confidence.</p> </div></div>",www.itworld.com,,546

<p>Apple rumors don&#x2019;t stop, and today there&#x2019;s a fresh one that discusses what we might be able to expect from the iPhone 6s later this year. Today&#x2019;s rumors sound a bit outlandish, but not out of the question.</p>
<p>According to&#xA0;<em>Money.UDN</em>, the iPhone 6s will pack new camera features, including a dual-lens camera with a built-in optical zoom function. Optical zoom allows you to take clearer shots when zooming in on a subject, as opposed to software-enabled zoom which often leaves the subject looking blurry or grainy. Storage options may also change.</p>
<p><em>U</em><em>DN</em>&#xA0;cites supply chain sources who suggest Apple will continue to offer the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screen sizes, but will bump the entry-level iPhone 6s/iPhone 6s &#xA0;Plus storage to 32GB instead of 16GB. There&#x2019;s also reportedly some new display technology at work.</p>
<p>Another supply chain &#x201C;legend&#x201D; discussed by <i>UDN&#xA0;</i>suggests that the iPhone 6s will employ &#x201C;two pressure sensors&#x201D; one of which will have a role in health monitoring functions, offering more accurate ways to track a user&#x2019;s heart rate and blood pressure. The site also lists a &#x201C;3D pressure sensor&#x201D; that may be built into the touch panel for an additional Z axis. To us, that suggests possible 3D user-interface interactions, though <i>UDN</i> instead points to 3D imaging technologies that might take advantage of the pressure sensor.</p>
<p>One of those rumors lines up with a patent Apple received in April of last year, which discussed <a href=""https://www.technobuffalo.com/2014/04/03/apple-explores-pressure-sensitive-touchscreens/"">presssure-sensitive touchscreen technology</a> that allows the display to distinguish between soft taps and stronger, more forceful inputs; that technology is also making its way into the Apple Watch.</p>
<p>Wacky? Maybe a bit, and the supply chain is often filled with outlandish rumors but, again, none of this seems completely out of the question. Whether these rumors come to fruition or not&#x2026; well, we won&#x2019;t know until closer to September 2015.</p> <div class=""attribution""> <label>Source:</label> <a class=""btn"" href=""http://money.udn.com/storypage.php?sub_id=5615&amp;art_id=638904"">UDN</a> <label>Via:</label> <a class=""btn"" href=""http://www.gforgames.com/gadgets/iphone-6s-dual-lens-3d-pressure-sensor-46064/"">GforGames</a> </div> </div>",www.technobuffalo.com,,326
http://www.slashgear.com/iphone-6s-rumors-suggest-new-camera-healthkit-sensors-13364315/,"iPhone 6S rumors suggest new camera, HealthKit sensors",,,"<div><div id=""post-prep""> <a class=""comments-count"" href=""http://www.slashgear.com/iphone-6s-rumors-suggest-new-camera-healthkit-sensors-13364315/#disqus""><span class=""dsq-postid"">8</span> <span></span></a> </div><div class=""content""> <p>The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are two of the more exciting products Apple has unleashed in quite some time. Of the two, differences are slight, but the camera hardware Apple went with on the iPhone 6 Plus is a good reason to stop and consider which you really want. A new rumor suggests those still standing in front of tables at the Apple Store might want to walk away for a few months, as the iPhone 6S camera might end up being even better than the iPhone 6 Plus&#x2019;.</p> <p><br>
According to <em>Money.UDN</em>, the iPhone 6S will have a dual-lens camera. <a href=""https://www.slashgear.com/apples-next-iphone-may-offer-dslr-quality-shots-courtesy-of-sony-19356438/"">We&#x2019;ve heard similar rumblings before</a>, as Sony announced new camera hardware for mobile devices with a &#x201C;dual lens&#x201D;. Sony makes the camera hardware for Apple&#x2019;s iPhone, so dual lens isn&#x2019;t so sensational.</p>
<p>Optical zoom, though &#x2014; that&#x2019;s interesting. According to Money, the iPhone 6S will have an optical zoom feature, which is something smartphones generally slouch on. Rather than rely on digital enhancements, a hardware fix for zoom may be inbound.</p>
<p>As if a cool new camera wasn&#x2019;t enough, the report also cites supply chain sources on pressure sensors which Apple is said to include on the next iPhone. One sensor will track blood pressure and heart rate, which makes sense for Apple&#x2019;s <a href=""https://www.slashgear.com/healthkit-apps-start-trickling-into-the-app-store-26348139/"">HealthKit</a>, but ultimately seems to clumsy for an iPhone.</p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-358531"" src=""https://c.slashgear.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/iphone-6-nfc-820x420-600x307.jpg"" alt=""iphone-6-nfc-820x420-600x307"" width=""600""></p>
<p>The second sensor is even more hard to understand. Supply chain sources say that one will be made available for use with a 3D interface. We&#x2019;ve seen <a href=""https://www.slashgear.com/apple-job-listing-suggest-vr-platform-on-the-horizon-24357161/"">job openings</a> for Apple&#x2019;s VR&#xA0;initiatives (which are kind of 3D), but it&#x2019;s early on for anything 3D for an iPhone, and it&#x2019;s an unlikely aesthetic change for Apple&#x2019;s iOS. In the wake of iOS 7&#x2019;s visual update, there&#x2019;s no way Apple would go full 3D.</p>
<p>Finally, the report suggests Apple is ditching the 16GB iPhone base model for a 32GB version. If that&#x2019;s true, good on them; it&#x2019;s overdue.</p>
<p>Much of these rumors seem like foie gras; force-fed from patent filings and other news tidbits. A new camera is likely, and we&#x2019;re sure Apple is at least entertaining the idea of dropping the underwhelming 16GB model. As for 3D or extra sensors packed into the iPhone 6S, we&#x2019;re not going to bite on that one.</p>

Rumors Suggest ‘Dual-Lens’ Camera, Apple Watch ‘Force Touch’ Feature",Fionna Agomuoh @FionnaatIBT,2015-01-14T22:14:39.000Z,"<div class=""article-body""><p>The cameras on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus may be some of the best on the smartphone market, but they could be trumped by the camera on the next iteration of the iPhone. Though the next phone -- possibly the &quot;iPhone 6s&quot; -- isn&apos;t expected for another eight months, sources within Apple Inc.&#x2019;s supply chain in Asia have detailed a &#x201C;dual-lens&#x201D; camera module, according to <a href=""http://money.udn.com/storypage.php?sub_id=5615&amp;art_id=638904"">Chinese publication UDN</a>. Such a feature would improve the camera&#x2019;s low-light performance and could also aid in optical image stabilization.</p><p>Apple has long used a single lens with a five-element design on its cameras. Minor camera upgrades on each new generation of iPhone have kept consumers satisfied. But in 2014, the manufacturer introduced a bigger update: optical image stabilization and phase-detection autofocus on the iPhone 6 Plus. The camera on the iPhone 6 Plus in particular is said to be on par with the image quality of point-and-shoot cameras. The iPhone 6 did not get that feature.</p><p>Now, Apple may provide the next iPhone with its largest camera upgrade in Apple&#x2019;s history. Information out of Apple&#x2019;s Asia supply chain has often been reliable in the past, and tallies with prior reports suggesting that Apple will put a camera in the new iPhone that will rival the image quality of DSLR cameras. <a href=""http://www.ibtimes.com/apple-iphone-7-rumors-next-gen-iphone-could-enjoy-biggest-camera-jump-ever-1726050"">Daring Fireball&apos;s John Gruber</a> said in November that Apple is working on a &#x201C;weird two-lens system&#x201D; for a future iPhone.</p><p>Devices like the <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/01/14/iphone-6s-dual-lens-camera-optical-zoom/"">HTC One M8 include</a> a dual-lens camera, created by the <a href=""http://www.cnet.com/news/corephotonics-dual-camera-tech-will-change-smartphone-imaging/"">Israeli startup Corephotonics</a>. But Apple usually uses lenses by Sony.</p><p>The &quot;iPhone 6s&quot; may also implement a feature called Force Touch, according to the Taipei-based touch module supplier TPK. Force Touch lets the Apple Watch interpret <a href=""http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/01/13/rumor-apples-iphone-6s-could-ship-with-dual-lens-camera-force-touch"">different levels of pressure</a> for different actions; a user can press heavily on the smartwatch screen to open an options menu, and then use a light tough to select an option. The Apple Watch is expected to <a href=""http://www.ibtimes.com/apple-watch-release-date-approaching-new-features-unveiled-iwatch-1782982"">launch sometime in March</a>.</p></div>",www.ibtimes.com,,324

These RAM modules offer low power consumption and a significant performance increase over the <a href=""http://www.macrumors.com/2014/09/16/iphone-6-plus-reviews-1-gb-ram/"">1GB of LPDDR3 RAM</a> used in the current-generation iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.

<br>
According to supply chain sources, the LPDDR4 RAM modules for the iPhone 6s will be supplied primarily by Hynix, Samsung, and Micron-Elpida. Elpida reportedly was behind schedule, but the company allegedly improved its manufacturing process to a level that will meet Apple&apos;s demand. Micron-Elpida and Hynix were identified in <a href=""https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPhone+6+Teardown/29213"">iFixit teardown analyses</a> as the RAM suppliers for Apple&apos;s current iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models.
<br>

<br>
Apple&apos;s next-generation iPhone also is rumored to sport the same design as the iPhone 6 with internal improvements such as an A9 processor and a dual-lens DSLR quality camera. Today&apos;s report also hints at the adoption of <a href=""https://www.apple.com/watch/technology/"">&quot;Force Touch&quot; technology</a> as seen on the Apple Watch to differentiate between quick taps and more forceful presses.
<br>

<br>
It is not clear, however, how Apple would implement such a system on the iPhone as it would appear to require a major shift in display technology for the device given that the Apple Watch uses a flexible OLED display paired with electrode sensors to support the Force Touch feature. <br><br></div>

<p>We&apos;ve coming out of our winter hibernation to an avalanche of new iPhone 6S rumors claiming Apple&apos;s next smartphone will have the biggest camera upgrade ever. There&apos;s also whispers of a 12-inch MacBook Air on the horizon, and a possible ARM-powered Mac in the next year.</p>
<p>Step up to the crystal ball and find out which of these rumors is most likely to come true in 2015.</p> </div> </div> <div class=""slide""> <div class=""caption""> <p><strong>The Rumor:</strong> Your iMacs and MacBooks will be powered by ARM processors in 1 - 2 years/</p>
<p><strong>The Verdict</strong> Not likely to happen yet. Ming Chi Kuo, aka &#x201C;the world&#x2019;s most accurate Apple analyst&#x201D; has been wrong a time or two, and <a href=""http://www.cultofmac.com/309236/crystal-baller-dual-lens-iphone-6s-arm-based-macs-6-crazy-apple-rumors/&#x201C;http://www.cultofmac.com/309019/worlds-top-apple-analyst-probably-wrong-arm-based-macs/"">I think this is time he&#x2019;s way off.</a> Ditching Intel chips has been rumored forever. It still doesn&#x2019;t make sense, as Apple would be sacrificing a lot of processing power for modest battery gains. It could happen in the next five years, but Kuo&#x2019;s prediction that we&#x2019;ll see an ARM powered MacBook in the next year sounds too soon to be true.</p> </div> </div> <div class=""slide""> <div class=""caption""> <p>The iPhone no longer has the best smartphone camera.</p> <p>Photo: Jim Merithew/Cult of Mac</p> </div> </div> <div class=""slide""> <div class=""caption""> <p><strong>The Rumor:</strong> GoPro is in trouble after Apple won a patent on its own <a href=""http://www.cultofmac.com/309236/crystal-baller-dual-lens-iphone-6s-arm-based-macs-6-crazy-apple-rumors/&#x201C;http://www.cultofmac.com/308932/apple-wins-camera-patent-sends-gopro-stock-tumbling/&#x201C;"">wearable camera system.</a> </p>
<p><strong>The Verdict</strong> Apple is not making a wearable camera. Not because it couldn&#x2019;t make a kickass wearable camera that&#x2019;s even better than GoPro, but because there&#x2019;s just not enough money in the wearable cameras market. If Apple can&#x2019;t sell tens of millions of units of a product every quarter there&#x2019;s no point in making it. GoPro investors can rest easy for another year.</p> </div> </div> <div class=""slide""> <div class=""caption""> <p><strong>The Rumor:</strong> Your next iPhone could sport a <a href=""http://www.cultofmac.com/309236/crystal-baller-dual-lens-iphone-6s-arm-based-macs-6-crazy-apple-rumors/&#x201C;http://www.cultofmac.com/309081/apple-hide-gaming-joystick-future-iphones/&#x201C;"">hidden gaming joystick</a> behind the home button.</p>
<p><strong>The Verdict</strong> Probably not going to happen. There are so many more parts that could break and need repair if Apple moved to a spring loaded joystick/home button. We still haven&#x2019;t seen any iPhone gaming cases take off, and this is certainly an intriguing idea, but this patent is mostly likely a glimpse into an alternative Apple universe we&#x2019;ll never see.</p> </div> </div> <div class=""slide""> <div class=""caption""> <p><strong>The Rumor:</strong> Apple already lined up a new a sapphire supplier.</p>
<p><strong>The Verdict</strong> Too early to tell. Ever since GTAT went belly up Apple&#x2019;s been hunting for a new sapphire supplier. Previous rumors have claimed Foxconn will step in, while a <a href=""http://www.cultofmac.com/309236/crystal-baller-dual-lens-iphone-6s-arm-based-macs-6-crazy-apple-rumors/&#x201C;http://www.cultofmac.com/308958/apple-already-lined-sapphire-supplier-iphone-6s/&#x201C;"">recent Wall Street Journal report</a> points to Apple supplier Desay as the possible GTAT replacement. The company already makes sapphire displays for its smartphones. Maybe the S in iPhone 6S will stand for &#x201C;sapphire.&#x201D;</p> </div> </div> <div class=""slide""> <div class=""caption""> <p><strong>The Rumor:</strong> <a href=""http://www.cultofmac.com/309236/crystal-baller-dual-lens-iphone-6s-arm-based-macs-6-crazy-apple-rumors/&#x201C;http://www.cultofmac.com/309086/apple-finally-give-iphone-ram-year/"">2GB of RAM</a> will be the new standard on the iPhone 6S.</p>
<p><strong>The Verdict</strong> The odds of the iPhone 6S getting 2GB of RAM is incredibly likely. We&#x2019;re not expecting a design overall on the 6S, but there should be plenty of big internal upgrades. The iPhone 6 only has 1GB of RAM. Doubling it will certainly make it wicked fast, and all those new Metal-coded games will look better than ever.</p> </div> </div> <div class=""slide""> <div class=""caption""> <p><strong>The Rumor:</strong> Future iPhones are <a href=""http://www.cultofmac.com/309236/crystal-baller-dual-lens-iphone-6s-arm-based-macs-6-crazy-apple-rumors/&#x201C;http://www.cultofmac.com/308392/apples-next-iphones-new-oled-displays/&#x201C;"">
set to get OLED displays</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The Verdict</strong> Count on it, but not until 2016. Foxconn is reportedly dedicating an entire factory to pumping out OLED displays for iPhones and Apple wearables. Mass production probably won&#x2019;t start until 2016, which will come just in time for Apple to swap out the iPhone 6s&#x2019; LCD display with a thinner, brighter OLED beauty.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <span id=""ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-127"" class=""ezoic-adpicker-ad""></span><span class=""ezoic-ad leader-1 adtester-container adtester-container-127""><span id=""div-gpt-ad-cultofmac_com-leader-1-0"" class=""ezoic-ad""></span></span><span id=""ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-126"" class=""ezoic-adpicker-ad""></span><span class=""ctx-article-root""></span> <span id=""ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-603"" class=""ezoic-adpicker-ad""></span></section> </article>",www.cultofmac.com,,598

</p><p> The next iPhone&apos;s camera may see a massive leap in image quality, <a href=""http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/01/13/rumor-apples-iphone-6s-could-ship-with-dual-lens-camera-force-touch""> Apple Insider reports</a> &#x2014; if it gets the rumoured inclusion of optical image zoom for the first time.
</p><p> The Apple news site is basing its report off rumours heard by the Japanese-language UDN and its &quot;ever-reliable sources in the Asian supply chain.&quot;&#xA0;
</p><p> Currently the iPhone &#x2014; like almost every other smartphone &#x2014; makes use of <em>digital</em> zoom. With digital zoom, zooming in doesn&apos;t add any extra detail to your photo &#x2014; it just enlarges and enhances what&apos;s already captured. In contrast, <em>optical</em> zoom uses an actual lens to to magnify and capture significantly more detail without sacrificing image quality. &#xA0;
</p><p> The camera in the iPhone 6 is already highly praised, but the rumoured new version will reportedly make use of a new dual-lens system to aid magnification &#x2014; like compact cameras and professional SLRs.
</p><p> It&apos;s a rumour in keeping with <a href=""http://uk.businessinsider.com/apple-iphone-7-rumors-2014-11"">what we&apos;ve already heard about the next iPhone.</a> Blogger and developer John Gruber, who has an excellent track record on Apple product news, said that the next model may have &quot;the biggest camera jump ever.&quot;
</p> <p> &quot;I&apos;ve heard that it&apos;s some kind of weird two-lens system where the back camera uses two lenses,&quot; Gruber said, &quot;and it somehow takes it up into DSLR quality imagery.&quot;&#xA0;
</p><p> And that&apos;s not the only new prediction about the next iPhone from UDN. <a href=""http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/01/13/rumor-apples-iphone-6s-could-ship-with-dual-lens-camera-force-touch""> The Apple smartphone is also reportedly to include &quot;Force Touch,&quot;</a> a pressure-sensitive touchscreen which is also included in the Apple Watch. A user could press lightly on an app to load it, or push more forcefully in order to bring up more options, for example.

On the most recent episode of <em>The Talk Show</em> <a href=""http://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2014/11/15/ep-100"">podcast</a>, <em>Daring Fireball&apos;s</em> John Gruber revealed that &quot;a birdie of a birdie&quot; told him Apple is working on a two-lens system for incorporation in the next-generation iPhone. </p>
&quot;The specific thing I heard is that next year&apos;s camera might be the biggest camera jump ever,&quot; Gruber said. &quot;I don&apos;t even know what sense this makes, but I&apos;ve heard that it&apos;s some kind of weird two-lens system where the back camera uses two lenses and it somehow takes it up into DSLR quality imagery.&quot;<p>
The notion of using multi-lens imaging systems to make up for a smartphone&apos;s small form factor is a relatively recent development. In March, HTC unveiled <a href=""http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/03/25/htc-unveils-5-htc-one-m8-with-gesture-controls-dual-rear-cameras-slo-mo-video"">the One M8</a> with a so-called &quot;Duo camera&quot; setup, which uses a secondary imaging sensor for depth data. </p><p>
An interesting startup called Corephotonics, which was profiled by <em>Engadget</em> earlier <a href=""http://www.engadget.com/2014/02/26/corephotonics-dual-lens-smartphone-camera/"">this year</a>, proposes a different approach. Corephotonics developed a dual-lens module with two distinct focal lengths, effectively negating resolution drops associated with digital zooming. One camera is used for wide shots, while the other is used for close-ups. As an added bonus, the system provides spatial data for 3D imagery due to its lens offset. </p><p>
While speculation, Apple could employ a similar system, or even stitch together image data from both camera modules, to achieve DSLR-quality high-resolution photos. The company has no shortage of patents covering smartphone camera technology, including <a href=""http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/11/26/apple-patents-lytro-like-refocusable-camera-for-iphone"">Lytro-like refocusing</a>, <a href=""http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/01/28/apple-granted-two-patents-for-interchangeable-iphone-camera-lenses"">interchangeable modules</a> and <a href=""http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/04/01/apple-may-use-bayonet-mounts-for-interchangeable-iphone-camera-lenses"">interchangeable external lenses</a>. </p><p>
Perhaps most similar to today&apos;s rumor is an invention for a <a href=""http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/07/30/apple-patents-three-sensor-three-lens-iphone-camera-for-enhanced-color-photos"">multi-sensor system</a> that gathers luminance and chrominance values separately, processes the data and outputs photos at exceptionally high resolutions with equally high color accuracy.</p></div>",,,311

<p><strong>Updated with iPhone 6s and 6s Plus bugs including problems with the Touch ID sensor, zoomed in apps, and unresponsive screen, PLUS: News that there are two different A9 chips being used - one by Samsung and one by TSMC, with the TSMC chip offering better battery life. <br></strong></p>
<p>If you&apos;ve got a new iPhone 6s&#xA0;you might like to take a look at our unboxing and setup video below:</p> <h2>iPhone 6s release date UK: When is the new iPhone coming out?</h2>
<p>The iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus are now available to buy from Apple, following their 9 September launch, subsequent 12 September pre-order kick off day and 25 September release day. The new phones became available to buy in stores from 25 September in 12 countries including the UK. They&apos;ll be in 130 countries by the end of the year.</p>

<h2>iPhone 6s chipgate: Apple using two different manufacturers for A9 chip<span> </span></h2>
<p>There are two types of A9 chips being used in the new iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, Chipworks <a href=""http://www.chipworks.com/about-chipworks/overview/blog/a9-is-tsmc-16nm-finfet-and-samsung-fabbed"">has discovered</a>. Apparently Apple is utilizing chips from Samsung and TSMC for the new devices.</p>
<p>The Samsung chips are smaller than the TSMC chips, which might sound like a benefit, but apparently the TSMC chips are more energy efficient and users are experiencing more battery life.</p>
<p>Chipworks discovered the two different A9 chips when they&#xA0; a number of new iPhones. AnandTech <a href=""http://www.anandtech.com/show/9665/apples-a9-soc-is-dual-sourced-from-samsung-tsmc"">writes</a> that the reason why the chipsets are different sizes is likely due to the different manufacturing processes being used, with Samsung using a 14nm technology and TSMC using 16nm technology. The difference in size is a few millimeters: the Samsung chip is 96mm2 while the TSMC chip is 104.5mm2.</p>
<p>The big issue with this revelation appears to be that some users are finding that they get more battery life from a phone using the TSMC chip. <a href=""http://forums.macrumors.com/threads/which-chip-does-your-6s-6s-have.1922967/page-21"">According</a> to Mac Rumours forum users, and some Reddit <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/3nn00t/live_test_results_iphone_6s_samsung_14nm_vs_tsmc/"">users</a>, users of the new phones are finding that the iPhones using the TSMC chip manage two more hours of battery life than iPhones using the Samsung chip.</p>
<h2>How can I find out which A9 chip is in my iPhone?</h2>
<p>A developer has released an app &#x2013; beware it is not approved by Apple so installing it may be risky &#x2013; that may let you identify which chip is in your device. The app developer Hiraku Jira claims that of the iPhone users who have run his program so far, the TSMC chip is in 70% of iPhone 6s and 40% of iPhone 6s Plus models. The app is available <a href=""http://demo.hiraku.tw/CPUIdentifier/"">here</a>, install at your own risk!</p>
<h2>iPhone 6s chipgate: Why you don&apos;t need to worry</h2>
<p>When chipgate hit the headlines and was declared a controversy, Apple decided to <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2015/10/08/apple-says-battery-performance-of-new-iphones-a9-chips-vary-only-2-3/"">offer a rare comment</a> to reassure iPhone 6s owners.</p>
<p>&quot;With the Apple-designed A9 chip in your iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus, you are getting the most advanced smartphone chip in the world. Every chip we ship meets Apple&apos;s highest standards for providing incredible performance and deliver great battery life, regardless of iPhone 6s capacity, colour or model.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Certain manufactured lab tests which run the processors with a continuous heavy workload until the battery depletes are not representative of real-world usage, since they spend an unrealistic amount of time at the highest CPU performance state. It&apos;s a misleading way to measure real-world battery life. Our testing and customer data show the actual battery life of the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, even taking into account variable component differences, vary within just 2-3% of each other.&quot;</p>
<p>In other words, if you&apos;re concerned about the chip in your iPhone 6s, don&apos;t be. A<a href=""http://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/10/samsung-vs-tsmc-comparing-the-battery-life-of-two-apple-a9s/"">s pointed out by</a> Ars Technica&apos;s battery life tests, which found that the only significant difference in battery life was during the Geekbench 3 test, which puts a huge strain on the processor that you&apos;d be unlikely to replicate in day-to-day use.</p>
<p>We&apos;re not suggesting that the variation is entirely acceptable - ideally all of Apple&apos;s chips should perform almost identically - but there&apos;s no doubt that the original reports were overblown and shouldn&apos;t concern the vast majority of iPhone 6s users.</p>

<h2>iPhone 6s and 6s Plus bugs: Problems with Touch ID sensor in iPhone 6s<span> </span></h2>
<p>Some iPhone 6s users are reporting problems with the Touch ID sensor overheating.</p>
<p>A report in the Daily Mail <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3261947/Apple-s-iPhone-6s-hot-property-literally-Customers-complain-Touch-ID-sensor-overheats-stops-working.html"">suggests</a> that the Touch ID sensor is getting too hot and therefore and not working in some models. It&#x2019;s suggested that users hard reset their iPhone by pressing the on-off switch and holding the Touch ID button until the phone shuts down (assuming the Touch ID button doesn&#x2019;t burn your finger) in order to solve the problem. (In other words, turn it off and turn it back on again...).</p>
<h2>iPhone 6s and 6s Plus bugs: unresponsive iPhone screen&#xA0;</h2>
<p>Some users are complaining that the iPhone 6s screen becomes unresponsive. It appears that the screen is only unresponsive for about 10 seconds.</p>
<p>The best way to fix this appears to be to do a hard reset by pressing the on-off switch and holding the Touch ID button until the phone shuts down.</p>
<h2>iPhone 6s and 6s Plus bugs: Zoomed display bug</h2>
<p>The release of the iPhone 6s on 25 September prompted a large number of people to upgrade from their old iPhone, especially those running older devices. However, those restoring from an iPhone 5/5s/5c backup via iCloud may have a bit of a shock, as some users are reporting a display bug that causes certain apps to zoom into apps on the iPhone 6s. Users on <a href=""https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7232283"">Apple&#x2019;s Support forums</a> note that the bug seems to affect Wallet, Weather, Watch, Calculator and Health, which is causing data to be cut off at the edges of the screen, as if zoomed in.</p>
<p><img class=""lz"" src=""https://cdn2.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3589633/walletdisplayissues.jpg"" alt="""" width=""544""></p>
<p>The issue is most prevalent in the Wallet app, as the cropped display means that users are unable to delete cards from the app. Apparently, turning on the Display Zoom feature from within the Display &amp; Brightness menu of the Settings app will fix the issue in Wallet, but will leave the rest of the iPhone zoomed in. It&#x2019;s not a suitable permanent fix, but until Apple releases an update to correct the error, it at least gives affected users a way to manage their cards in the Wallet app. It&#x2019;s said that Apple is working on the error, and users running iOS 9.1 beta 3 say the problem has been fixed, so it looks like we haven&#x2019;t got long to wait!</p>
<p>Mac Rumours forum users are suggesting that the issue can be fixed if users switch their iPhone to zoomed display in Settings &gt; Display &amp; Brightness &gt; View.</p>
<h2>iPhone 6s and 6s Plus bugs: Phones randomly turning off</h2>
<p>There are a small number of iPhone 6s and 6s Plus users reporting that their devices are turning off at random, even if the devices in question have a completely full battery. Users then report that their devices would become completely unresponsive, with holding the power button having no effect on its&#x2019; state. Some of the affected users have also complained that their home buttons would also be unusually hot once their device had eventually turned back on. The issue has been raised in <a href=""https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7249096"">Apple&#x2019;s online forums</a>, as well as on <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/3n2k07/iphone_6s_turned_off_completely/"">Reddit</a>, which has seen scores of users complaining about the bug.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s thought that the bug mainly affects devices running iOS 9.0.1, released shortly after the launch of iOS 9 to combat earlier bug fixes, such as getting stuck at the &#x2018;Slide to Upgrade&#x2019; section of the iPhone software update. Apple has since released iOS 9.0.2, which brings with it a handful of bug fixes including one that allowed anyone to bypass the lock screen to access photos and contacts using Siri. However, the fix for the above issue isn&#x2019;t included in the change log for iOS 9.0.2, so we can only assume this is an ongoing issue.</p>
<p>Although there is no official word from Apple about the bug, and whether it&#x2019;s a software or hardware issue, there is a workaround available. According to Reddit users, performing a &#x2018;hard reset&#x2019; usually works, and is performed by holding both the home and lock/power buttons for around 10 seconds. Be careful not to let go of the power button and continue holding the home button, as this will put the iPhone into DFU mode and will have to be restored using iTunes.</p>
<p>As well as this, we at Macworld UK have personally experienced a slightly different bug on our iPhone 6s running iOS 9.0.2. We were using our iPhone 6s when the screen displayed a vibrant green colour &#x2013; however this green wasn&#x2019;t consistent across the display, and looked a bit like a Gameboy display would as it runs out of battery; it was blotchy, and faded away. After this, our iPhone display turned off and after a few seconds, our iPhone 6s restarted with no further issues. We&#x2019;ve only experienced this bug once, and we&#x2019;ll be monitoring our iPhone over the coming days to see if it happens again.</p>

<h2>How to buy an iPhone 6s from the Apple Store: Has the iPhone 6s sold out?</h2>
<p>If you want to head into an Apple Store to buy your iPhone 6s, you can certainly expect to see queues and it&apos;s possible that the particular model you&apos;re after will be sold out, especially if you&apos;re visiting one of Apple&apos;s more popular stores.</p>
<p>If you want to buy your iPhone 6s&#xA0; on contract rather than from Apple directly, you an expect to find them in retail branches of EE, O2, Three, Virgin and Vodafone.</p>
<p>From Saturday 26 September, you&apos;ll be able to reserve your iPhone to pick up in store, and Apple says that most stores will have the iPhone available for walk-in customers every day, so we expect regular deliveries are planned.</p>
<h2>iPhone 6s &amp; 6s Plus price UK: How much do the new iPhones cost?</h2>
<p>The iPhone 6s starts at &#xA3;539, while the iPhone 6s Plus starts at &#xA3;619. Breaking that down further:</p>
<p>iPhone 6s 16GB: &#xA3;539iPhone 6s 64GB: &#xA3;619<p>iPhone 6s 128GB: &#xA3;699</p></p>
<p>iPhone 6s Plus 16GB: &#xA3;619iPhone 6s Plus 64GB: &#xA3;699<p>iPhone 6s Plus 128GB: &#xA3;789</p></p>

<h2>Where to buy the iPhone 6s in the UK</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, Apple began pre-orders for the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus on Saturday 12 September at 8.01am, and then became available to buy on 25 September from 8am.</p>
<p>On <a href=""http://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-iphone/iphone6s"">Apple&apos;s Online Store</a>, you&apos;ll be able to order the new iPhone unsubsidised for the prices listed above, but most models now have a 1-2 week dispatch estimate so you might want to try reserving a model to buy in store (which you can do by pressing the button below &apos;Add to Bag&apos; at checkout on the Apple Store) or buying the phone from a carrier or third-party seller.</p>

<h2>iPhone 6s &amp; 6s Plus: Is the iPhone 6s waterproof?</h2>
<p><span>Reports are suggesting the new iPhone 6s is waterproof. This is based on iFixit&#x2019;s tear down of the new iPhone. iFixIt claims that it found an adhesive running around the edge of the iPhone along with silicon seals on the connectors inside the iPhone. This could serve to protect the iPhone from water damage. However, Apple is not claiming that the iPhone is waterproof, so we don&#x2019;t suggest that you take any risks. The company famously has a water indicator inside the iPhone that show if the iPhone has had water damage when you take it in for repair. </span></p>
<h2>iPhone 6s &amp; 6s Plus: Design and build</h2>
<p><img class=""lz"" src=""https://cdn2.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3589633/iphone_6s_review_41.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1600""></p>
<p>As suspected, the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus have the same screen sizes as their predecessors, with the 6s offering a 4.7in Retina display and the iPhone 6S Plus offering 5.5in.</p>
<p>New to this new generation of iPhone, though, is the Rose Gold model, which adds to the Gold, Silver and Space Grey already available. The new Rose Gold matches the new aluminium Rose Gold Apple Watch, too.</p>
<p><img class=""lz"" src=""https://cdn2.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3589633/iphone_6s_review_55.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1600""></p>
<p>Each model is made with the same aluminium as the Apple Watch, called Series 7000 Aluminium, which is designed to be more durable (and hopefully prevent a repeat of Bendgate!)</p>
<h2>iPhone 6S new features: 3D Touch</h2>
<p>Apple has introduced a brand-new screen technology called 3D Touch, which lets you &apos;Peek&apos; by pressing lightly, or &apos;Pop&apos; by pressing harder.</p>
<p><img class=""lz"" src=""https://cdn2.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3589633/iphone_6s_review.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1600""></p>
<p>For example, if you&apos;re browsing through your emails and see one you think might be interesting, you can &apos;Peek&apos; to see what it says and if you don&apos;t fancy responding right now you can let go to go right back to your emails without pressing back. But if you do want to reply, you can click harder to &apos;Pop&apos; to the email, as shown above.</p>
<p>Another example given by Apple is links. If someone sends you a link via iMessage or any other application, you can Peek at it by pressing lightly to see what&apos;s on that web page. Let go and you&apos;ll be right back in the app the link was sent to you in. And if you want to fully open the page in Safari, you can press harder to Pop into it.</p>
<p>Other uses include viewing photos you&apos;ve just taken within the Camera app, taking a Peek at locations within the Maps app by lightly pressing on an address and more.</p>
<p>App icons now become shortcuts that let you choose exactly where in that app you want to go, a new feature tha Apple calls Quick Actions. You can press on the Camera icon to take a selfie. And you can press on the Facebook icon to quickly update your status or check-in without opening the app.</p>

<p><img class=""lz"" src=""https://cdn2.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3589633/iphone_6s_review_11.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1600""></p>
<p>If you want to call one of your favourite contacts you can press the Phone button (rather than tap it), or press the Maps button to get directions home, mark your location, send your location or search nearby.</p>
<p>Multitasking is easier than ever with 3D Touch, too. You can press on the screen and swipe to scroll through the apps you&apos;ve got open, rather than double clicking the Home button.</p>
<p>3D Touch works with a taptic engine for haptic feedback you can feel, just like the Apple Watch and the trackpad on the new MacBooks.</p>
<p>That&apos;s only the tip of the 3D Touch iceberg, particularly as third-party developers begin introducing the technology into their apps, too.</p>
<h2>iPhone 6s &amp; 6s Plus specs and hardware</h2>
<p><img class=""lz"" src=""https://cdn2.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3589633/iphone_6s_review_20.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1600""></p>
<p>Inside the new iPhone 6s and 6s Plus&#xA0;is the new 64-bit A9 chip, as predicted. That chip is 70% faster than the A8, and 90% faster when it comes to graphics performance. We&apos;re looking forward to running our benchmark tests on the new iPhone to find out how it compares with rivals.</p>
<p>That A9 chip is paired with an M9 motion co-processor that collects health and fitness data to help the A9 run more efficiently and concentrate on other tasks.</p>
<p>There&apos;s also a second-generation Touch ID fingerprint sensor that&apos;s up to two times faster.</p>
<p>Just like the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, the new models are available in 16GB, 64GB and 128GB configurations.</p>
<p>Connectivity has been improved too. There&apos;s now LTE Advanced and faster WiFi.</p>
<h2>iPhone 6s &amp; 6s Plus camera</h2>
<p><img class=""lz"" src=""https://cdn2.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3589633/iphone_6s_review_54.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1600""></p>
<p>The iPhone 6s&#xA0;and 6s Plus feature a 12Mp iSight rear-facing camera rather than the 8Mp cameras of their&#xA0;predecessors. Indeed, Apple has refused to add more pixels to the camera for years, claiming that more megapixels doesn&#x2019;t mean better quality shots, which is true: more megapixels really just means the shot will take more MB of storage up. However, now Apple is happy to add more megapixels because they have also added more focus pixels for more better auto focus and added a new tech called deep trench isolation for accurate colour.</p>
<p>The iPhone 6S Plus&apos;s camera is capable of capturing 4K video, as is the camera in the 6S. (One difference between the two devices&apos; video-capture capabilities, however, is the fact that the 6s Plus offers optical image stabilisation.)</p>
<p>There&apos;s also a 5Mp front-facing camera for selfies and FaceTime, and the entire display can be used as a front-facing flash.</p>
<p>In terms of camera software, Apple is introducing Live Photos. You can capture a photo that has an extended moment before and after you pressed the shutter button, capturing a few seconds of motion and audio for a photo that can come to life a little like something out of Harry Potter! We&apos;re slightly concerned about how much space that&apos;ll take up, though.</p>
<p><img class=""lz"" src=""https://cdn2.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3530504/new-iphone-6s-and-6s-plus.jpg"" alt="""" width=""800""></p>
<h2>iPhone 6s software</h2>
<p>The iPhone 6s will run iOS 9, which we&apos;ve already spent lots of time with after it was unveiled at WWDC 2015 earlier this year.</p>
<p>Additionally, a new software feature is the ability to activate Siri by saying &quot;Hey Siri&quot; at any time, not just when the device is plugged in.</p> <p>More to follow.</p>

Others have rallied around Sony&apos;s predicament. </p> <p> George Clooney, in an interview with Deadline.com on Thursday, revealed that he had circulated a petition earlier in the week saying &quot;we fully support Sony&apos;s decision not to submit to these hackers&apos; demands&quot; -- but no one was willing to sign it. </p> <p> &quot;It was a large number of people. It was sent to basically the heads of every place,&quot; Clooney said without naming names. </p> <p> The petition said, &quot;This is not just an attack on Sony. It involves every studio, every network, every business and every individual in this country,&quot; and it concluded, &quot;We hope these hackers are brought to justice but until they are, we will not stand in fear. We will stand together.&quot; </p> <p> It&apos;s outdated now, since Sony did cancel &quot;The Interview.&quot; In the interview, Clooney expressed sadness that &quot;as we watched one group be completely vilified, nobody stood up.&quot; </p>   <div class=""storytimestamp""> <span class=""cnnStorySource""> CNNMoney (New York) </span> <span class=""cnnDateStamp"">First published December 19, 2014: 10:12 AM ET</span> </div> </div></div>",money.cnn.com,,641

</p> <p> In the email, the hackers say Sony made the right decision pulling &quot;The Interview,&quot; which portrayed the assassination of North Korea&apos;s leader Kim Jong Un.
</p> <p> US officials believe the hackers were backed by North Korea.&#xA0;
</p> <p> Those hackers promised not to leak any more private Sony data unless Sony reverses its decision and distributes the movie anyway.
</p> <p> Here&apos;s the email, as read on air by Stelter:
</p> <p> It&apos;s very wise that you have made a decision to cancel the release of &quot;The Interview.&quot; It will be very useful for you ... We ensure the security of your data unless you make additional trouble.
</p> <p><a href=""http://www.thewrap.com/sony-hackers-issue-new-threat-in-wake-the-interview-cancellation-says-cnn/""> According to TheWrap</a>, several Sony employees received another message from a person claiming to be the head of the &quot;Guardians of Peace&quot; warning the studio to not release &quot;The Interview&quot; in any form.
</p> <p> Here&apos;s the message in full from TheWrap:
</p> <blockquote> <p id="":2ke"" class=""kl""> &#x201C;Now we want you never let the movie released, distributed or leaked in any form of, for instance, DVD or piracy.&#x201D; </p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p id="":2kf"" class=""kl""> &#x201C;we still have your private and sensitive data&#x201D; and claims that they will &#x201C;ensure the security of your data unless you make additional trouble.&#x201D; </p> <p> &#x201C;And we want everything related to the movie, including its trailers, as well as its full version down from any website hosting them immediately.&#x201D; </p> </blockquote> <p> Sony decided to <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/reports-top-movie-theater-chains-just-caved-to-sony-hackers-2014-12""> pull &quot;The Interview&quot; premiere on Wednesday</a> after five of the top movie-theater chains said they wouldn&apos;t show the movie following threats by the hackers, known as Guardians of Peace (GOP).
</p> <p> Sony said it had <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/sony-wont-be-releasing-the-interview-anywhere-anytime-soon-2014-12""> no plans to release the movie</a> through video on demand or online.
</p> <p> Sony&apos;s decision has caused a lot of debate about what kind of precedent it sets when a major corporation bends to the will of hackers or terrorists.

<p>The emails suggested information stolen during the hack could be released if Sony fails to ensure that the film is never seen:</p>
<blockquote><p>The hacker message is effectively a victory lap, telling the studio, &#x201C;Now we want you never let the movie released, distributed or leaked in any form of, for instance, DVD or piracy.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The message also says, &#x201C;And we want everything related to the movie, including its trailers, as well as its full version down from any website hosting them immediately.&#x201D;</p>
<p>It warns the studio executives that &#x201C;we still have your private and sensitive data&#x201D; and claims that they will &#x201C;ensure the security of your data unless you make additional trouble.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>&#x201C;This is a problem that&#x2019;s going to be with us for a very long time,&#x201D; </strong>Senator Dianne Feinstein has announced from the pulpit of CNN.<br></p>
<p>Feinstein, the chair of the Senate intelligence committee, said it is imperative that Congress pass legislation that would &#x201C;allow companies to share information with each other and the government &#x2026; and be protected from liability for doing so.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Pressed by Jake Tapper on the question of whether Sony made a mistake, she refused to assign blame, saying she thought that chairman Michael Lynton &#x201C;did practice all due diligence, he did call the White House, he recognizes there are contracts with big theater companies.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;This is a complicated matter &#x2026;if something were to happen, who is liable for a loss of life?&#x201D;</p>
<p>She instead returned to the responsibility of the federal government &#x201C;to respond appropriately, imminently.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;This can&#x2019;t continue to happen in my view. This is a problem that&#x2019;s going to be with us for a very long time. so we have to get certain strictures in place to get a handle on it.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I hope we can convince the North Koreans that this action has a very heavy price.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Finally, Feinstein urged US allies to write an international accord on cybersecurity, saying that the US has already been attacked by hackers in China, Russia, Iran and the states.</p>
<p>&#x201C;At some point if we face a disastrous attack, and this is what we must prevent, only an international agreement [can] solve it.&#x201D;</p>

<h2 class=""block-title"">Sony chairman: &apos;we made no mistake&apos;</h2>
<div class=""block-elements block-elements--no-byline"">
<p><strong>Sony made no mistake in pulling <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-interview"" class=""u-underline"">The Interview</a>, the company&#x2019;s chairman insists</strong>, despite President Obama&#x2019;s assertion that they did just that.<br></p>
<p>Michael Lynton told CNN&#x2019;s Fareed Zakaria that Sony &#x201C;experienced the worst cyberattack in American history and persevered under enormous stress for months.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Lynton tries to shift blame onto the theaters at &#x201C;the crucial moment that the threat came out, from what was called the GOP at the time&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The movie theaters came to us one by one over the course of a very short period of time, and announced that the would not carry the film. At that point we had no [choice] but to not proceed. And that&#x2019;s all.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The CEO even argued &#x201C;we have not backed down&#x201D; and said that Sony still has &#x201C;every desire to have the American public see this movie.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He said the company is considering &#x201C;a number of options&#x201D;, but that it requires an intermediary such as Netflix or a video-on-demand distributor. None, he said, have &#x201C;stepped forward and said they are willing.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;We don&#x2019;t have that direct interface with the American public.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Asked by Zakaria whether he&#x2019;d still make the film, Lynton tried to put on a brave face: &#x201C;I would make the movie again, for the same reasons we made it in the first place. It was a funny comedy, it served as political satire. Knowing what I know now we might&#x2019;ve done some things slightly differently, but I think a lot of events have overtaken us in a way we have no control of.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Obama ended with a reflection on the past year and his entire presidency:</p>
<p>&#x201C;One of the great things about this job is you get to meet American people of every race and every faith. And what I don&#x2019;t think is always captured in our political debates is that the vast majority of people are trying to do the right thing. And people are basically good and have good intentions. Sometimes our institutions don&#x2019;t work [as well]. Maybe police departments [do the wrong thing and] surface hidden biases.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He says videos like that of Eric Garner&#x2019;s death &#x201C;trouble everybody&#x201D;. </p>
<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve gone through difficult times. It is your job, press corps, to report on all the mistakes that are made and all the bad things that happen and crises that look like they&#x2019;re popping, and I understand that.</p>
<p>&#x201C;But through persistent effort and faith in the American people, things get better.&#x201D; </p>
<p>Obama listed the economy, energy, education and other issues as having improved over the past six years.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Part of what I hope as we reflect on the new year is this should generate some confidence. When we work together we can&#x2019;t be stopped.</p>
<p><strong>&#x201C;And now I&#x2019;m going on vacation.&#x201D;</strong></p>

<p>One last question gets in, on the topic of race relations in the US.</p>
<p><strong>&#x201C;Black America in the aggregate is better off than when I came into office,&#x201D; </strong>Obama said.</p>
<p>He continued: &#x201C;This is a legacy of a troubled racial past, but that&#x2019;s not an excuse for black folks, and I think the overwhelming majority of black folks understand that&#x2019;s not an excuse.&#x201D;</p>
<p>People are working hard, &#x201C;hustling every day&#x201D;, Obama said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;They&#x2019;re starting behind oftentimes in the race. What&#x2019;s true for all Americans is we should be willing to provide people a hand up &#x2013; not a handout. Help them afford college, and if we can help them succeed that&#x2019;s going to be good for all of us.</p>
<p>&#x201C;A lot of what we&#x2019;re seeing is coloured by Ferguson, and what we&#x2019;ve seen in New York, and that is that there are specific instances at least where law enforcement doesn&#x2019;t feel as if it&#x2019;s being applied in a colorblind fashion.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The taskforce that I&#x2019;ve formed is supposed to respond back to me in 90 days &#x2013; not with a bunch of abstract musings about race relations but some really concrete practical things that law enforcement, and police departments, can begin using right now.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Obama also responded to a question about the broader press around police killings and existing divides between black and white Americans.</p>
<p><strong>&#x201C;I actually think it&#x2019;s been a healthy conversation. </strong><strong>This is not a new phenomenon. </strong><strong>You&#x2019;re not going to solve the problem if it&#x2019;s not being talked about.&#x201D;</strong></p>

<p>The Keystone XL pipeline comes up in what Obama says is the last question.</p>
<p>Obama: &#x201C;<strong>At issue in Keystone is not American oil. It is Canadian oil,</strong><strong> that is drawn out of tar sands.</strong> That oil, currently, is being shipped out, through rails and trucks, and it would save Canadian companies and the Canadian oil industry an enormous amount of money if they could simply pump it through the United States down to the Gulf.</p>
<p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s very little impact, nominal impact, on US gas prices, what the average consumer American cares about, by having this Canadian oil get through.</p>
<p>&#x201C;And sometimes the implication is that gas prices are going to go lower here in the States, but they&#x2019;re not. It&#x2019;s good for Canadian oil companies. But it&#x2019;s not going to be even a nominal benefit to American jobs.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He talks more about jobs.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Now the creation of the pipeline itself is probably going to create a couple of thousand jobs. There&#x2019;s probably a couple additional jobs that can be created in the refining process down at the Gulf.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Those aren&#x2019;t insignificant, he says, but next to the jobs created by work on roads and bridges they simply don&#x2019;t compare. He pitches infrastructure to Congress again.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We could probably create hundreds of thousands of jobs, or a million jobs, so if that&#x2019;s the argument there are lots of ways to create American jobs.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I want to make sure that if in fact this process goes forward, I want to make sure it&#x2019;s not adding to the problem of climate change, which I do consider a very serious issue. And it does increase the cost to the American people.&#x201D;</p>

<p>A reporter now asks what happens if Cuba&#x2019;s human rights abuses worsen.</p>
<p>&#x201C;That doesn&#x2019;t mean that over the next two years we can&#x2019;t anticipate and take certain actions that we may find deeply troubling, either inside of Cuba or with respect to their foreign policy. And that could put significant strains on the relationship,&#x201D; Obama replies.</p>
<p>&#x201C;But that&#x2019;s true of a lot of countries out there where we have an embassy.</p>
<p>&#x201C;And the whole point of normalizing relations gives us the greater opportunity to have an influence.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Obama says he would be surprised if the Castro regime &#x201C;moves to effectively undermine their own policy&#x201D;.</p>
<p><strong>&#x201C;There will be carrots and sticks that we can apply.&#x201D;</strong></p>
<p>Asked about whether Fidel came up in his conversation with President Raul Castro of Cuba, Obama says that the ex-president was mentioned only in passing. Obama says he took about 15 minutes to get his preliminary remarks out of the way, &#x201C;and the end of my remarks I apologised for taking such a long time.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;And he said, &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t worry about it Mr President, you still have a chance to break Fidel&#x2019;s record, he once spoke for seven hours straight.&#x2019; And then Raul gave his own preliminary remarks that lasted at least twice as long as mine, and that gave me the opportunity to say &#x2018;it runs in the family&#x2019;.&#x201D;</p>
<p><strong>About the embargo:</strong></p>
<p>&#x201C;We can&#x2019;t unilaterally bring down the embargo. But what I do think is going to happen is there&#x2019;s going to be a process where Congress digests it; there are bipartisan supporters [...] people will see the reactions that unfold. I think there&#x2019;s going to be a healthy debate in Congress.&#x201D;</p>

<div class=""block-elements block-elements--no-byline"">
<p><strong>&#x201C;We have no indication that <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/north-korea"" class=""u-underline"">North Korea</a> was acting in conjunction with another country,&#x201D;</strong> <strong>Obama said in relation to the Sony hack.</strong></p>
<p>He is then asked about Cuba, and his position on the regime and human rights abuses there.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We are glad Cuba has released more than 50 dissidents,&#x201D; he says, adding that he&#x2019;s glad Raul Castro agreed to work with the UN and international groups. </p>

<p>&#x201C;I share the concerns of dissidents there and human rights activists. This is still a regime that represses its people. As I said in the announcement I don&#x2019;t anticipiate overnight changes. But I know deep in my bones that if you do the same thing for 50 years and nothing&#x2019;s changed, you&#x2019;ve got to do something else.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Then he moves onto the long term strategy of the tectonic shift in US-Cuban relations.</p>
<p><strong>&#x201C;Suddenly Cuba is open to the world in ways it hasn&#x2019;t been</strong>. It&#x2019;s open to Americans. It&#x2019;s open to church groups visiting their fellow believers in ways they haven&#x2019;t before. It opens the prospect of telecommunications and the internet.</p>
<p>&#x201C;And over time that chips away at this hermetically sealed society, and I believe that offers the best prospect of greater freedom, greater self-determination of the Cuban people. I think it&#x2019;ll happen in fits and starts, but we&#x2019;ll have a better chance.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Change is going to come to Cuba, it has to. They&#x2019;ve been reliant for years, first on subsidies from the Soviet Union, then from Venezuela.&#x201D; It has to change, Obama says, though he doesn&#x2019;t know how quickly.</p>

In addition to the screen size uptick, the overall design of the phones changed, bringing a more well-rounded (punny!) form factor, and slipping us away form the squared-off design of iPhones past. Still, one thing remained unanswered: how would Apple treat the smaller iPhones moving forward? The iPhone 5C is near its end of cycle, and the iPhone 5S will likely disappear next year. A new rumor suggests Apple is going to come back strong with a new 4-inch phone to replace them.</p> <p><br>
As <a href=""https://www.slashgear.com/iphone-6-leak-apple-has-supply-chain-handled-three-sizes-incoming-27330675/"">we heard they might ahead of the iPhone 6 launch,</a> a new (well, not sure I can really say that, but you get the point) iPhone is rumored to check in next year. With a 4-inch screen, it will keep Apple rooted to its one-handed past while we double-tap the home button to shrink screens on the larger phones.</p>
<p>The questions surrounding this are why, and how. Why would Apple create an entirely new &#x2014; but still smaller &#x2014; iPhone? How will they market it? Is it an emerging market flagship, or a budget-friendly offering for the US?</p>
<p>Let&#x2019;s also keep in mind this is a rumor, and comes via a source we&#x2019;re not familiar with. The &#x201C;new iPhone&#x201D; could even be an iPod refresh, instead of the &#x201C;female friendly&#x201D; iPhone the Chinese source claims.</p>
<p>As the Apple TV becomes more smart-home hub than streaming box, I&#x2019;ve long held the position that <a href=""https://www.slashgear.com/it-might-be-time-to-kiss-the-ipod-goodbye-10350251/"">a robust remote with the ability to run apps is a good idea,</a> and the iPod fits that purpose nicely. Still speculative, but I&#x2019;d much rather that than a new, small iPhone.</p>

          <div class=""content"">Apple is reportedly planning to expand its 2015 iPhone lineup to include a new 4-inch model, according to <a href=""http://www.feng.com/iPhone/news/2014-12-03/For-single--handed-operation-_601719.shtml"">Asian sources</a> [<a href=""http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A//www.feng.com/iPhone/news/2014-12-03/For-single--handed-operation-_601719.shtml&amp;hl=en&amp;langpair=auto%7Cen&amp;tbb=1&amp;ie=UTF-8"">Google Translate</a>] cited by <a href=""http://www.gforgames.com/gadgets/2015-iphone-lineup-include-4-inch-model-45926/""><em>G for Games</em></a>. The smaller form factor would bring back the ease of one-hand usage that was lost when Apple introduced its larger iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus handsets. The supply chain sources suggest the new phone may debut in the second half 2015 with female users as the targeted audience for the smaller phone. 
<br>

<br>
<img src=""http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2014/12/iphone_screen_sizes.jpg"" alt=""iphone_screen_sizes"" width=""681"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-431393"">
<br>
Even without a new 4-inch model, Apple&apos;s history of product lineups suggests the 4-inch iPhone 5s would remain in the lineup in 2015 as the low-end offering once the current models slide down and the iPhone 5c is presumably <a href=""http://www.macrumors.com/2014/11/26/apple-stop-production-iphone-5c-2015/"">discontinued</a>. But if Apple wants to maintain a 4-inch option beyond the 2015 lineup, it would make sense to invest in an updated version of that size as the iPhone 5s ages.
<br>

<br>
Still, the sourcing on today&apos;s rumor is not entirely clear and a track record is unknown, so it is difficult to assess the potential validity of the claim. As a result, we would not put too much stock in it for the time being until or unless additional information surfaces in the coming months.
<br>

<br>
Even without a new 4-inch model this year, iPhone sales have been strong for the new 4.7-inch iPhone 6 and the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus, with Apple setting <a href=""http://www.macrumors.com/2014/09/22/iphone-6-6-plus-launch-weekend-10-million/"">a new sales record</a> in the first weekend of availability. While the iPhone 6 <a href=""http://www.macrumors.com/2014/11/14/iphone-6-ratios/"">is outselling</a> the 6 Plus, the larger handset is holding its own in the phablet market, <a href=""http://www.macrumors.com/2014/12/04/iphone-6-plus-41-larger-phone-sales/"">accounting</a> for 41 percent of large-screened smartphone sales in the past three months.<br><br></div>

<p> <span class=""KonaFilter image-container display-table float_right image on-image""> <img src=""http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/54833769eab8ea4d5395b35c-1200-924/tim-cook-apple-174.jpg"" alt=""tim cook apple""> <span class=""caption-source""> <span class=""caption"">Apple CEO Tim Cook</span> <span class=""source"">REUTERS/Robert Galbraith</span> </span> </span>
</p><p> Of all the Apple rumors coming out of the Far East recently, the one with the most legitimacy seems to be Apple producing an iPhone with a 4-inch display next year.
</p><p> <span>Although the reports are unsubstantiated, returning to the small smartphone market would be a good move for Apple.</span>
</p><p> <span> <span>According to the</span> <a href=""http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/tech-news/Apple-to-launch-4-inch-iPhone-next-year-Report/articleshow/45385470.cms"">&#xA0;Electronic Times of Taiwan</a> <span>, the supply chain for Apple production in 2015 includes the components for a smaller handset than the iPhone 6.</span> </span>
</p><p> <span>The report states that Apple is producing the smaller model &#x201C;for the convenience of single-handed operation of female users.&#x201D;</span>
</p><p> <span>Even though Apple has turned to the larger smartphone and phablet market with the release of the iPhone 5 and 6, respectively, there are still users who prefer the smaller screens and the ability to use a smartphone with just one hand. As phones get bigger, it becomes impossible to do even the simplest tasks without both hands.&#xA0;</span>
</p> <p> <span> <span>The new&#xA0;</span> <a href=""http://www.gsmarena.com/rumor_apple_to_launch_new_4_iphone_next_year-news-10391.php"">phone is rumored</a> <span>&#xA0;to be replacing the iPhone 5c model. The 5c has been Apple&#x2019;s budget model since its release in September 2013.</span> </span>
</p><p> <span>The 5c lacked many of the features of the 5s model, such as using the Apple 5 model&#x2019;s A6 chip instead of the A7 that came with the 5s, not having Touch ID, lacking the M7 motion co-processor and other minor features. The iPhone 5c was discontinued in September 2014 when the iPhone 6 was announced.</span>
</p><p> <span>As a budget iPhone, the 5c was too expensive, with the price in the same range as other lines flagship smart phones. Reduced production of the model signaled a decline in demand as early as October 2013.</span>
</p><p> <span> <span>According to&#xA0;</span> <a href=""http://pocketnow.com/2014/12/04/apple-4-inch-iphone-2015"">Pocketnow</a> <span>, this rumor might signify that Apple wants to standardize their current iPhone models with a small (4-inch), mid-sized (4.7-inch) and phablet (5.5-inch) display. Whether the new 4-inch iPhone would be marketed as a budget iPhone is impossible to say at this point.&#xA0;</span> </span>
</p><p> <span> <span>Apple stayed with a 3.5-inch display for five generations as its rivals grew progressively larger. Steve Jobs, founder of Apple, said in 2010 that the smaller screen was better because it was easier to &#x201C;get your hands around it.&#x201D;</span> <br> </span>

The iPhone 6, which was the company&apos;s first major step into the bigger screen size market, has been a huge success and revived Apple for many fans. Insiders say it is highly unlikely that it will backtrack on that trend for a smaller screen.</p> <p>Still, others say that the rumor may not be as far-fetched as one would imagine. Last year&apos;s iPhone 5c was a flop and is on its way out, with the iPhone 5 not too far behind. In an effort to still retain some of the budget market, Apple may be truly looking into re-releasing smaller screens.</p> <p>The rumor purports that Apple will be producing the 4-inch displays in response to customer surveys vying for a return to smaller phones.</p> <p>Those who believe the release of small screen phones are possible are also speculating that Apple would be releasing a cheaper iPhone 6c, iPhone 6 mini, or perhaps even a redesign of the iPhone 5c.</p> <p>In the meantime, it is expected that Apple will launch a new line of phones in conjunction with the much-anticipated Apple Watch in the early months of 2015. No word yet if the company will be adding an iPhone 6s or perhaps an iPhone 7 to their phone lineup, or if these rumored 4-inch display phones will even be launched.</p> <div class=""at-tag""> <div class=""t2""><a href=""http://www.techtimes.com/tags/iphone"">iPhone</a>, <a href=""http://www.techtimes.com/tags/apple"">Apple</a>, <a href=""http://www.techtimes.com/tags/iphone-6"">iPhone 6</a>, <a href=""http://www.techtimes.com/tags/iphone-rumors"">iPhone Rumors</a>, <a href=""http://www.techtimes.com/tags/iphone-mini"">iPhone Mini</a></div> </div> <div class=""at-copy"">&#xA9; 2017 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

<p>Apparently, supply chain sources have revealed that <a href=""https://bgr.com/tag/apple/"">Apple</a> has planned a new 4-inch iPhone model for the second half of 2015, a screen size the company used in three earlier&#xA0;iPhone versions so far, including the iPhone 5, iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c.<span id=""more-4234433""></span></p>

						<p>Amazon boss Jeff Bezos is primed and ready for a fresh assault on the streaming-video space.</p>
<p>The e-commerce giant will roll out a new ad-supported streaming offering early next year that will be separate from its $99-a-year Prime membership, which includes a video service, sources said.</p>
<p>The ad-supported option &#x2014; part of an overhaul of its media offerings &#x2014; poses a serious challenge to streaming rivals such as Hulu and Netflix, analysts said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;If they do an ad-supported service, they will decouple it from Prime and that is a Netflix killer,&#x201D; Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said. &#x201C;It won&#x2019;t be $99 a year.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Pachter suggested Amazon would undercut Netflix&#x2019;s current monthly price of $7.99.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Who wouldn&#x2019;t switch if you were poor or you&#x2019;re a cord-cutter?&#x201D; he added.</p>
<p>Although it will be separate from Prime, the ad-supported service is ultimately a bid by Amazon to lure people to eventually pay up for Prime membership, said one ad source familiar with Amazon&#x2019;s plans.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The main point is to bring in more users that you can eventually up-sell to Prime, or to get to a broader audience that doesn&#x2019;t want to pay for Prime, in order to increase their video share,&#x201D; the source said.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal reported in March that Amazon was weighing such a move, but sources confirmed that it&#x2019;s a definite go.</p>
<p>Amazon is prepping a new attack at a time when its video service is gaining ground, sources said. Amazon doesn&#x2019;t disclose the number of Prime members, but RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney estimates it has 50 million global customers.</p>
<p>While Prime&#x2019;s big draw has been two-day shipping, about half of Prime subscribers use the video service that is included with it, or around 25 million, sources said. By comparison, Netflix has 33 million domestic subscribers.</p>
<p>A recent Sandvine study also shows that Amazon is making major strides &#x2014; but has a long way to go before catching Netflix. Amazon&#x2019;s broadband traffic on fixed networks grew from 1.61 percent to 2.58 percent, the study showed. One change is that Amazon snagged popular HBO content, including &#x201C;The Wire,&#x201D; &#x201C;True Blood&#x201D; and &#x201C;Boardwalk Empire.&#x201D; Netflix accounts for 32.39 percent of aggregate traffic.</p>
<p>Rumors have been rampant that Amazon plans to let advertisers into its media ecosystem. Amazon has already experimented with ads in some shows, according to tech site Re/code.</p>
<p>For advertisers, the service could be the Holy Grail in terms of targeting. In theory, Amazon could tell if ads viewed online led to purchases on its retail site.</p>
<p>The news that Nielsen will start rating shows on subscription video services starting with Netflix is likely to encourage advertisers who want to make the leap without forcing Amazon to give up its own data.</p>
<p>Amazon will also have leverage over content producers when it comes to the way it chooses to promote shows and movies within its growing ecosystem, a Hollywood source said.</p>
<p>Amazon didn&#x2019;t return a call seeking comment.</p>

If the <em>Post&apos;s</em> report proves accurate, the launch of a larger ad-supported streaming service may mean that the current version successfully enticed Amazon customers to buy Prime. Amazon recently scored a deal to stream classic HBO programs like <em>The Sopranos</em> and <em>Six Feet Under</em> in a minor coup over Netflix. But it still has less than a tenth of its competitor&apos;s size -- and we imagine that &quot;free&quot; looks pretty good to a lot of users, ads or not. So far Amazon hasn&apos;t commented on the matter, but we&apos;ve reached out for more information.</p><p><strong>Update</strong>: Amazon told us it has &quot;not announced any plans to offer an ad-supported video streaming service.&quot; That doesn&apos;t mean that it <em>won&apos;t</em>, though, so let us translate that into non-PR-speak for you: &quot;No comment.&quot; Its full statement is below.</p><blockquote><p>We currently offer the first episode of some television shows free with ads through our First Episode Free feature on Amazon Instant Video, and there are display ads on some short videos such as movie and game trailers.

</p><p> The service would exist in addition to its $99 Prime membership subscription, which includes free, two-day shipping on thousands of items alongside music, TV, and movie streaming options.<span>&#xA0;</span>
</p><p><a href=""http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304688104579465690663213198?mod=djemalertTECH""> The Wall Street Journal reported</a> similar plans in March, pegging the service as being free. At the time,&#xA0;<a href=""http://variety.com/2014/digital/news/amazon-is-plotting-free-tv-and-music-video-streaming-service-but-stocked-with-what-1201149147/"">Amazon denied that it had plans</a> to offer a free streaming-media service. &#xA0;
</p><p> The Post, however, doesn&apos;t say that the service would be free, and instead suggests that the new service would likely compete with Netflix and Hulu, while under-cutting them on price (Netflix costs and Hulu Plus cost $7.99 a month).&#xA0;
</p><p> Amazon&apos;s Sally Fouts sent the following via email: &quot;We currently offer the first episode of some television shows free with ads through our&#xA0;First Episode Free feature on Amazon Instant Video, and there are display ads on some short videos such as movie and game trailers. We&#x2019;re often experimenting with new offers and experiences for customers, but we have not announced any plans to offer an ad-supported video streaming service.&quot;
</p> <p> At its core, the idea of this service makes sense.
</p><p> Amazon could use this new, cheaper streaming service as a way to ease people into its ecosystem so they&apos;ll be more likely to eventually make the jump to Prime, while also giving it a way to entice potential customers who don&apos;t care about Prime&apos;s free shipping but want a Netflix alternative.&#xA0;

<p>But the <em>Post</em>&apos;s sources now say an ad-supported version is definitely happening. But oddly, the report suggests that it might not be free. One source speculated that Amazon may undercut Netflix&apos;s current monthly price of $7.99, though.</p>
<p>&quot;The main point is to bring in more users that you can eventually up-sell to Prime, or to get to a broader audience that doesn&apos;t want to pay for Prime, in order to increase their video share,&quot; a source told the news outlet.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Amazon is already gaining ground on streaming rivals. A recent Sandvine <a href=""https://www.sandvine.com/pr/2014/11/20/sandvine-report-netflix-dominates-still-amazon-instant-video-growing.html"">study</a> found that Amazon Instant Video has established itself as the second largest paid streaming video service in North America, though Netflix still dominates.</p>
<p>Netflix accounted for 34.9 percent of downstream North American traffic in the peak evening hours this year. Amazon had only 2.6 percent of downstream traffic, but its share has more than doubled in the past 18 months, Sandvine said.</p>
<p>On other news, Amazon is also mulling its own travel service, which would let you book stays at independent hotels and resorts, according to a <a href=""http://skift.com/2014/11/20/exclusive-amazon-to-get-into-hotel-booking-with-launch-of-travel-site/"">report</a> from travel news site Skift. The so-called Amazon Travel site, set to launch around Jan. 1, would reportedly &quot;feature a curated selection of hotels within a few&#xA0;hours&apos; drive from New York, Los Angeles, and Seattle.&quot;</p>
<p>Amazon declined to comment about the travel site rumor.</p> <p>For more, check out 16 Tips Every Amazon Addict Should Know in the slideshow above, as well as <a class="""" href=""http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2456217,00.asp"">60 Geeky Movies, TV Shows on Amazon You Should Stream Now</a>.</p>

http://bgr.com/2014/11/21/amazon-free-video-streaming-service/,Amazon reportedly developing a new weapon to combat Netflix,,2014-11-21T23:45:37.000Z,"<div class=""entry-content""> <p>In order to better compete against rivals like Netflix, <a href=""http://bgr.com/tag/amazon/"">Amazon</a> may launch a free, ad-supported streaming video service at some point early next year, <em><a href=""http://nypost.com/2014/11/21/amazon-plans-a-streaming-video-alternative/"">The New York Post</a></em> has learned.<span id=""more-4173324""></span></p>
<p><strong>FROM EARLIER: <a href=""http://bgr.com/2014/11/21/amazon-black-friday-2014-sales/"">Everything you need to know about Amazon&#x2019;s crazy Black Friday doorbuster deals</a></strong></p>
<p>Not many details about the new service are available at this time, and it&#x2019;s not known what Amazon will call it, but it&#x2019;ll apparently be available for free&#xA0;and will not be tethered to Amazon Prime, which already offers unlimited video streaming to subscribers.</p> <p>&#x201C;If they do an ad-supported service, they will decouple it from Prime and that is a <a href=""http://bgr.com/tag/netflix/"">Netflix</a> killer,&#x201D; Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said. &#x201C;It won&#x2019;t be $99 a year. Who wouldn&#x2019;t switch if you were poor or you&#x2019;re a cord-cutter?&#x201D;</p>
<p>One source familiar with Amazon&#x2019;s plans said the retailer wants customers who initially choose the new free streaming option to then convert to Amazon Prime, a subscription that costs $99 per year. At the same time, Amazon also wants to increase its video streaming share, as it&#x2019;s competing against other popular services such as Netflix and Hulu.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The main point is to bring in more users that you can eventually up-sell to Prime, or to get to a broader audience that doesn&#x2019;t want to pay for Prime, in order to increase their video share,&#x201D; the source said.</p>
<p>Amazon is estimated to have some 50 million global Prime members, of which roughly 25 million use the video service included in the subscription.</p>
<p>However, Amazon only has a 2.58% share of broadband traffic, compared to Netflix&#x2019;s 32.39% share of aggregate traffic. Netflix currently has 33 million subscribers in the U.S.</p>
<p>In addition to video streaming, Amazon could also benefit from targeted advertising, as it would be able to tell whether customers actually purchase products on Amazon.com after viewing ads for them while streaming TV shows.</p> <div class=""entry-tags""> Tags: <a href=""http://bgr.com/tag/amazon/"">amazon</a>, <a href=""http://bgr.com/tag/hulu/"">Hulu</a>, <a href=""http://bgr.com/tag/netflix/"">netflix</a> </div> </div>",bgr.com,,316

<p><strong>FROM EARLIER: <a href=""http://bgr.com/2014/10/13/iphone-6-plus-bendgate-apple-fan/"">Yet another Apple fan who mocked &#x2018;Bendgate&#x2019; finds himself disturbed by a slightly bent iPhone 6 Plus</a></strong></p>
<p>Redditor<em> doctorkuddles</em>&#xA0;says that he just purchased an 128GB iPhone 6 Plus that feels different than&#xA0;his wife&#x2019;s early 16GB iPhone 6 Plus model.</p> <p>&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t prove anything. I can only look at my iPhone 6 Plus I got yesterday, and the 6 Plus my wife got on September 20th,&#x201D; he explains. &#x201C;We have identical phones minus the GB size (I have 128GB, she has the 16GB) Both are space gray. I started looking at both phones closely.</p>
<p>&#x201C;First difference I noticed is the smoothness on the week one phone compared to the week 6 (?) phone. Completely softer and smoother. The second difference I noted was when I started tapping (&#x2018;flicking&#x2019;) the back and sides of both phones. Right where the previous &#x2018;bends&#x2019; were in previous 6 Pluses (above and below the volume rocker), there is a night and day difference in sound,&#x201D; he adds.</p>
<p><em>doctorkuddles</em> further says&#xA0;he used a stethoscope to listen to the iPhone 6 Plus and found that his 128GB phone sounds &#x201C;much more dull toned, indicating to me it&#x2019;s more solid&#x201D; whereas &#x201C;her phone had a lot more percussion sound, indicating that area was previously hollow&#x201D;</p>
<p>He then took it under a microscope, without dismantling it. He looked through the cracks of the volume buttons and spotted a &#x201C;red colored object placed in the volume down button crank.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Furthermore, he weighed and measured both devices and found out that while both devices are identical in size, the 128GB version is 21g heavier than the 16GB model.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I just don&#x2019;t see the memory being that much heavier,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>No actual images or videos of any of these findings have been published, so it&#x2019;s not clear whether <em>doctorkuddles</em> has actually discovered anything.</p>
<p>Interestingly, he contacted the teardown experts at iFixit on the matter, who purchased a brand new 128GB iPhone 6 Plus and weighed it.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It weighs 173.5 grams, a whopping 0.8 grams more than the Day One unit,&#x201D; iFixit&#x2019;s <em>mdjorie</em> wrote on the same Reddit thread. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know what&#x2019;s up with your new unit, OP, but our new unit definitely doesn&#x2019;t weigh 21 grams more than the Day One device.&#x201D;</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s not clear whether Apple made any internal design changes to its iPhones since the <a href=""http://bgr.com/tag/bendgate/"">Bendgate</a> issue was first reported, or whether it would be able to roll out changes so fast in case it did. But a previous report did reveal that <a href=""http://bgr.com/2014/09/05/faulty-iphone-6-returns/"">Apple takes product launch-related issues and flaws very seriously</a>&#xA0;and looks&#xA0;to fix problems as fast as possible following their discovery.</p>
<p>UPDATE: <a href=""http://9to5mac.com/2014/10/31/iphone-6-plus-silent-update-weight-difference/""><em>9to5Mac&#x2019;s</em> Jordan Kahn has done some digging</a> and has found that there&#x2019;s no truth to the claim that Apple has altered the 6 Plus to make it less susceptible to bending.</p>
<p>&#x201C;A footnote on Apple&#x2019;s specs website for iPhone 6 Plus notes that &#x201C;Size and weight vary by configuration and manufacturing process,&#x201D; and sources tell us&#xA0;a 1.5 gram weight variance between any two iPhone 6 Plus units&#xA0;is within what is expected,&#x201D; Kahn explains.</p> <div class=""entry-tags""> Tags: <a href=""http://bgr.com/tag/apple/"">Apple</a>, <a href=""http://bgr.com/tag/bendgate/"">Bendgate</a>, <a href=""http://bgr.com/tag/iphone-6-plus/"">iPhone 6 Plus</a> </div> </div>",bgr.com,,621

<p class=""p1"">Earlier today users noticed an increase in weight for newly purchased units of the iPhone 6 Plus compared to the 172grams Apple quotes on its website. Repair guide website iFixit noted in <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/2kqlgh/does_anyone_think_apple_had_quietly_fixed_the_6/"">a Reddit post</a> that it tested a newly purchased device and found a weight difference of 172.7 grams to 173.5 grams. <i>&#x201C;We had a Day One iPhone 6 Plus, 128 GB, Silver, Verizon unit. I put it on the dealer scale we have on-premises, and it weighed 172.7 grams. It&#x2019;s on the high end, but still within Apple&#x2019;s listed 172 gram spec.&#xA0;</i><i>I just went to the store and bought a brand-spanking-new iPhone 6 Plus, 128 GB, Space Gray, Verizon unit&#x2026;It weighs 173.5 grams, a whopping 0.8 grams more than the Day One unit.&#x201D;&#xA0;</i></p>
<p class=""p1"">The reports have been <a href=""http://bgr.com/2014/10/31/iphone-6-plus-bendgate-design-fix/"">widely picked up</a> by several news sites and some are speculating that the weight difference could be due to added reinforcements to address bending concerns. We&#x2019;ve confirmed, however, that the difference in weight is normal and that newly shipping iPhone 6 Plus units have not been silently altered.</p>
<p class=""p1"">A footnote on Apple&#x2019;s specs website for iPhone 6 Plus notes that &#x201C;Size and weight vary by configuration and manufacturing process,&#x201D; and sources tell us&#xA0;a 1.5 gram weight variance between any two iPhone 6 Plus units&#xA0;is within what is expected.</p>

<p> The source said Lenovo&apos;s first offer would be $15.00 per share, with a deal ultimately getting done around $18.00 per share.</p>
<p> Lenovo&apos;s <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-24/lenovo-says-rim-bid-among-options-to-boost-mobile-unit.html"">CFO Wong Wai Ming</a> said in January 2013, that BlackBerry (still known as Research in Motion at that time) was one of many possible opportunities for the company. BlackBerry played down the comment.</p>

<p> Lenovo announced Wednesday, the creation of a new company focused on internet-based smart devices, to be launched on April 1, 2015. The company will operate under a separate name and brand.</p>
<p> A spokesperson for BlackBerry told Benzinga on Saturday, the company does not comment on rumors or speculation. A Lenovo spokesperson was not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p> BlackBerry closed Friday at $9.49, a gain of 2 percent.</p>

Aside from setting up a third mobile business to target China specifically, rumors are resurfacing that Lenovo is eying to buy <a href=""https://www.slashgear.com/tags/blackberry/"">BlackBerry</a> out of its woes. Or perhaps the two moves are one and the same, which doesn&#x2019;t make sense either. Whatever Lenovo has planned, we might very well know this week as sources close to the matter tip that Lenovo will be making an offer to buy BlackBerry sometime this week.</p> <p>This isn&#x2019;t exactly the first time that the largest PC maker has set its eyes on BlackBerry. It was exactly a year ago since we <a href=""https://www.slashgear.com/lenovo-blackberry-bid-potential-resurfaces-17301949/"">last heard</a> about the Chinese firm&#x2019;s interest in the Canadian company. Of course, neither company confirmed nor denied the matter. The Canadian government, however, was allegedly working in the background to have it blocked, due to security concerns of a Chinese company buying out a Canadian one.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to today, Lenovo is said to make a $15 per share offer to BlackBerry, possibly ending up at around $18 per share. If any of this is true, Lenovo would be what others would call it spreading itself thin across continents. It was lately rumored to be planning on starting <a href=""https://www.slashgear.com/lenovo-to-step-up-in-china-by-starting-a-new-phone-brand-16350890/"">a new mobile phone venture</a> in China specifically to rival top dog Xiaomi while still maintaining its own Lenovo branded smartphones in that country. In the US, it is still waiting to conclude the acquisition of <a href=""https://www.slashgear.com/tags/motorola/"">Motorola Mobility</a>, whose name and sales also extend to other countries. If it does or at least tries to acquire BlackBerry, then it means that the company is willing to have a fourth mobile business under its control.</p>
<p>The other big question is whether BlackBerry is willing to sell. There have been many rumors and offers during the height of the company&#x2019;s financial crisis, none of which have come to pass as BlackBerry has soldiered on to keep its own brand and business under its own direction. If you only look at news coverage, the company doesn&#x2019;t seem to be in as dire straits, which makes the prospect of a buyout even less enticing. Plus, the company has just launched a fresh new attempt at both the smartphone and the enterprise market, and isn&#x2019;t exactly done yet. Whether those are actually enough to keep BlackBerry afloat is too early to tell, which might be another reason it would not be so interested in an acquisition.</p>

<h3><strong>Lenovo plans smart devices</strong></h3>
<p>On Wednesday, Lenovo stated that it is planning to launch its internet-based smart devices on Apr. 1, 2015. Also it was reported that the company will operate under a separate name and brand. A BlackBerry spokesperson told Benzinga that the company would not respond to rumors or speculations, and a Lenovo spokesperson was not available for the comment.</p>
<p>Lenovo CFO Wong Wai Ming said in January 2013 that the Canadian smartphone maker was under consideration from the company. However, BlackBerry declined any such possibility that time. Only last year, the <a href=""http://www.valuewalk.com/2014/07/blackberry-ltd-bbry-preferred-by-german-government/"">government</a> banned a potential BlackBerry deal with Lenovo due to some national security issues.</p>
<h3><strong>BlackBerry shipment estimates lowered</strong></h3>
<p>Recently analyst Todd Coupland at CIBC World Markets speculated&#xA0;that the estimated shipment volume for BlackBerry devices for the third and fourth quarters would be weak. Coupland added though that the initial demand for the BlackBerry Passport is encouraging compared to modest expectations. Coupland noted that on Google Trends, there was an increased search interest for the device that was similar to the BB10&#x2019;s number two devices. Also the Canadian company sold an unexpected 200,000 units of the Passport on the very first day of its launch.</p>
<p>Coupland said, &#x201C;Shipments, however, are being held back by supply constraints for unique screens and keyboards that will limit any upside in fiscal Q3.&#x201D;</p>
<p>According to the analyst, demand for BB7 and Z30 devices of BlackBerry is going down, therefore, shipment forecasts for BlackBerry devices have been revised down from 2.3 million units to 1.6 million units for the third quarter. Additionally, for the fourth-quarter, his shipment estimate is down from 2.5 million units to 1.5 million.</p>
<p>BlackBerry CEO John Chen is expecting total <a href=""http://www.valuewalk.com/2014/10/blackberry-shipment-estimates-reduced/"">shipments</a>&#xA0;to hit 10 million units annually by 2017. Coupland says that the company still has a lot to do to revive its position in hardware before it can achieve its target and expects the company to ship only 6.8 million units in 2016 and 2017.</p> <div class=""tag_list"">Tags: <a href=""http://www.valuewalk.com/tag/bbry/"">BBRY</a> <a href=""http://www.valuewalk.com/tag/blackberry/"">BlackBerry</a> <a href=""http://www.valuewalk.com/tag/john-chen/"">John Chen</a> <a href=""http://www.valuewalk.com/tag/lenovo/"">lenovo</a> <a href=""http://www.valuewalk.com/tag/passport/"">Passport</a> <a href=""http://www.valuewalk.com/tag/shipments/"">shipments</a></div> </div> </article>",www.valuewalk.com,,394

<p>According to a Saturday <a href=""http://www.benzinga.com/news/14/10/4933512/exclusive-lenovo-could-make-an-offer-for-blackberry-as-early-as-this-week"" class=""external"">Benzinga</a> report that references &#x201C;a source familiar with the matter&#x201D;, it has been revealed that Chinese computer maker Lenovo Group (<span>OTCBB:LNVGY</span>) could make an offer to acquire Canadian telecommunication and wireless equipment company BlackBerry Ltd. (<span>BBRY</span>) as early as this week. The source told the publication that Lenovo&#x2019;s first offer for the struggling smartphone maker would be &#x201C;$15.00 per share, with a deal ultimately getting done around $18.00 per share.&#x201D;</p>
<p>This isn&#x2019;t the first time the $15 billion market cap company has been linked with BlackBerry. In January 2013, Lenovo&#x2019;s chief financial officer Wong Wai Ming told <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-24/lenovo-says-rim-bid-among-options-to-boost-mobile-unit.html"" class=""external"">Bloomberg</a> &#x201C;We are looking at all opportunities &#x2013; RIM [still known as Research in Motion at that time] and many others. We&#x2019;ll have no hesitation if the right opportunity comes along.&#x201D;</p>
<p>BlackBerry played down the comment. Later that month Canadian Industry Minister Christian Paradis said that he would prefer the smarthone maker to grow &#x201C;organically.&#x201D; The Canadian government reportedly stopped Lenovo&#x2019;s takeover of BlackBerry due to national security concerns.</p>
<p>BlackBerry declined to comment to Benzinga on a possible Lenovo bid.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The company does not comment on rumors or speculation,&#x201D; said a spokesman for the Waterloo, Ontario-based company.</p>
<p>BBRY climbed 2.04 percent to $9.49 at the close in New York&#x2019;s Friday Nas session.</p> </div> </article>",wallstreetpit.com,,213

<p>Lenovo has already purchased Motorola from Google, and now according to a recent report, the company is interested in another smartphone maker, BlackBerry.</p>
<p>Back in<a href=""http://www.geeky-gadgets.com/lenovo-might-be-interested-in-acquiring-blackberry-says-a-report-17-10-2013/""> October</a> of last year, we heard rumors that Lenovo were interested in buying BlackBerry, and according to a recent report, Lenovo are still interested in the acquisition.</p> <p>Lenovo are rumored to be offering around $15 per share for BlackBerry, and may even increase that to around $18 per share, which is quite a bit higher than their current price of around $9.50.</p>
<p>BlackBerry has been turning things around recently, the latest financial results were better than expected, and the company appears to be doing better with their new BlackBerry Passport handsets than previous devices.</p>
<p>Lenovo has big plans for their new smartphone business, and intends to launch a new subsidiary in China that will focus solely on smartphones, so BlackBerry could be a smart buy for the company.</p>
<p>As soon as we get some more details on whether Lenovo will be making an offer on BlackBerry, we will let you guys know.</p>

<p>&#x2014;&#x2014;<br>
<strong>UPDATE #2:</strong> <a href=""https://consumerist.com/2014/10/08/comcast-apologizes-for-customers-bad-service-but-not-for-role-in-getting-him-fired/"">Comcast has apologized for the horrible service and billing that Conal experienced during his year-plus as a customer, but says that &#x201C;nobody at Comcast asked for him to be fired.&#x201D;</a></p>
<p>&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href=""https://consumerist.com/2014/10/08/former-employer-of-man-fired-for-complaining-to-comcast-speaks-out-but-doesnt-say-much/"">Conal&#x2019;s former employers have given a brief explanation of his dismissal, without providing any details as to what exactly he said to Comcast that merited terminating his employment.</a></p>
<p>&#x2014;&#x2014;-</p>
<p>When you complain to your cable company, you certainly don&#x2019;t expect that the cable company will then contact your employer and discuss your complaint. But that&#x2019;s exactly what happened to one former Comcast customer who says he was fired after the cable company called a partner at his accounting firm.</p>
<aside class=""lf-aside-right""><span><strong>TL;DR Version</strong></span><br>
&#x2022; Customer spends 11 months&#xA0;being overcharged by Comcast.&#x2022; Customer&#x2019;s complaints go unresolved.
<p>&#x2022; Customer contacts office of Comcast&#x2019;s Controller to complain about billing practices.</p>
<p>&#x2022; Comcast contacts customer&#x2019;s employer, which happens to do a lot of business with Comcast, says customer used employer&#x2019;s name during complaint.</p>
<p>&#x2022; Customer insists he did not use company name; fired by employer anyway.</p>
<p>&#x2022; Comcast will not release e-mails or audio recordings to counter customer&#x2019;s claim that he didn&#x2019;t use the name of his employer.</p>
</aside>
<h4>IT BEGAN INNOCENTLY ENOUGH&#x2026;</h4>
<p>Conal began subscribing to Comcast service in early 2013 after he says he was sold a 9-month promotional pricing offer. But from the start, there were issues with his service, as he was being charged for set-top boxes that had yet to be activated. Additionally, someone at Comcast billing had misspelled Conal&#x2019;s last name, meaning some of his bills were not being delivered.</p>
<p>He says he met with a Comcast rep in May 2013 about the billing issues and promised they would all be sorted out, but things only got worse.</p>
<p>A few months later, the promotional discount shrunk and Conal&#x2019;s monthly bill increased by $20, in addition to still being charged for unactivated devices in his house. Comcast also twice charged him an additional $7 for a second modem he did not have.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, attempts to get a resolution from Comcast went unanswered.</p>
<h4>CUTTING THE CORD</h4>
<p>He attempted to cancel his service in Oct. 2013 but says a Comcast rep convinced him that the billing issues would be resolved and that he would get free DVR service and The Movie Channel for three months as compensation.</p>
<p>But things didn&#x2019;t just continue as they had before; Comcast somehow managed to sink even lower than it had before, sending Conal about a dozen pieces of equipment that he didn&#x2019;t order.</p>
<p>&#x201C;There were a few DVRs, modem, standard boxes and equipment that I was unfamiliar with,&#x201D; he says.</p>
<p>Making matters worse, Comcast billed him $1,820 for all this stuff he&#x2019;d never requested and had no use for.</p>
<p>When Conal returned all the equipment to Comcast and, being an experienced accountant at one of the nation&#x2019;s most prestigious firms, even prepared a spreadsheet detailing every charge, overcharge, payment and credit on his account for his brief time as a Comcast customer.</p>
<p>He says even this didn&#x2019;t convince Comcast that there was a problem and that Conal had been overcharged. And even though it wasn&#x2019;t yet past due, Comcast sent Conal&#x2019;s account into collections in Feb. 2014.</p>
<h4>THE CALL IN QUESTION</h4>
<p>And so on Feb. 6, 2014, he chose to try going above Comcast&#x2019;s customer service, which hadn&#x2019;t been of any help in the year he&#x2019;d been a subscriber, and instead contacted the office of the company&#x2019;s Controller. He spoke to someone in that office who promised Conal would receive a call back to address the issues.</p>
<p>He describes that callback as &#x201C;bizarre,&#x201D; with the rep not identifying which company she was calling from, just starting out with &#x201C;How can I help you?&#x201D; Then she kept insisting that a technician had shown up for an appointment, but wouldn&#x2019;t specify which appointment. The rep then began asking him for the color of his house.</p>
<p>So he tried the Controller&#x2019;s office again, to let them know that the rep they&#x2019;d sent his way had failed miserably at her job.</p>
<p>During this call, he says that he mentioned that Comcast&#x2019;s billing and accounting issues should probably be investigated by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), a private-sector oversight operation. This ultimately led to two service calls where no one ever showed up and no explanations were given.</p>
<p>But something did happen. Just not anything good.</p>
<h4>WE KNOW WHERE YOU WORK</h4>
<p>Remember how we briefly mentioned above that Conal worked for a large, prestigious accounting firm? Comcast certainly noticed that fact, especially since that firm is one that does business with Comcast.</p>
<p>At some point shortly after that call, someone from Comcast contacted a partner at the firm to discuss Conal. This led to an ethics investigation and Conal&#x2019;s subsequent dismissal from his job; a job where he says he&#x2019;d only received positive feedback and reviews for his work.</p>
<p>Comcast maintained that Conal used the name of his employer in an attempt to get leverage. Conal insists that he never mentioned his employer by name, but believes that someone in the Comcast Controller&#x2019;s office looked him up online and figured out where he worked.</p>
<p>When he was fired, Conal&#x2019;s employer explained that the reason for the dismissal was an e-mail from Comcast that summarized conversations between Conal and Comcast employees.</p>
<p>But Conal has never seen this e-mail in order to say whether it&#x2019;s accurate and Comcast has thus far refused to release any tapes of the phone calls related to this matter.</p>
<p>And while his former employer did provide consulting services to Comcast, it was not the accounting firm that audited Comcast&#x2019;s books. So Conal doesn&#x2019;t quite see how mentioning the name of his employer would have helped gain him any leverage.</p>
<p>In response to a letter from Conal&#x2019;s lawyer &#x2014; he has not filed a lawsuit, but it&#x2019;s not out of the question &#x2014; Comcast&#x2019;s Senior Deputy General Counsel admits that the company did contact Conal&#x2019;s employer but says that Conal &#x201C;is not in a position to complain that the firm came to learn&#x201D; about his dispute with Comcast.</p>
<h4>THE HEART OF THE MATTER</h4>
<p>I think whether or not Conal mentioned his employer is beside the point. The problem should not have reached the point where he was even reaching out the Comcast Controller&#x2019;s office.</p>
<p>Had the billing issues been fixed on the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth chance that he gave Comcast to address the issue, the call in question would never have happened.</p>
<p>And even if Conal did identify his employer in the hope of getting his billing issue fixed, he wouldn&#x2019;t have been trying to get preferential treatment; just the service he&#x2019;d paid for.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m also curious why, even though Comcast insists that Conal attempted to leverage his place of business to get his issue resolved, it has not specifically cited language that he allegedly used in the call.</p>
<p>How many times a day do Comcast reps hear a customer say something like &#x201C;I&#x2019;m a lawyer&#x201D; or &#x201C;I&#x2019;m a big shot at [fill in the blank]&#x201D;? How many of those result in Comcast going out of its way to contact that customer&#x2019;s employer?</p>
<p>We reached out to Comcast to ask whether it&#x2019;s company policy to contact customers&#x2019; employers. No one answered that question, but a rep for Comcast did give a brief statement.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Our customers deserve the best experience every time they interact with us,&#x201D; reads the statement. Comcast says it has previously apologized to Conal, but adds &#x201C;we will review his lawyer&#x2019;s letter and respond as quickly as possible.&#x201D;</p>

<p>There have been lots of &#x201C;Comcast delivers bad customer service&#x201D; stories lately &#x2014; so overwhelming, in fact, <a href=""http://www.phillymag.com/news/2014/09/26/comcast-names-exec-charge-making-customers-less-ragey/"">that the company just appointed an executive to solve the problem</a>&#xA0;amid worries that <a href=""http://www.phillymag.com/news/2014/10/01/will-customer-service-kill-comcast-merger/"">disgruntled customers could derail the company&#x2019;s merger with Time Warner&#xA0;</a>&#x2014; but the latest story may be the worst: A Comcast customer says the company got him fired from the job.</p> <p><a href=""http://consumerist.com/2014/10/06/unhappy-customer-comcast-told-my-employer-about-complaint-got-me-fired/"">Consumerist reports</a> that the customer &#x2014; known in the story only as &#x201C;<strong>Conal</strong>&#x201D; &#x2014; began subscribing to Comcast in 2013 under a promotional offer, but almost immediately found himself charged for set-top boxes that had not been activated. He says he met with a Comcast rep in May of that year to sort out the billing issues, but they actually got worse from there.</p>
<p>He attempted to cancel, but was persuaded to stay for three free months of The Movie Channel; the company ended up sending&#xA0;him items he hadn&#x2019;t&#xA0;order and charged him more than $1,800 for them. Conal, an accountant, then contacted Comcast&#x2019;s controller. Consumerist reports: &#x201C;During this call, he says that he mentioned that Comcast&#x2019;s billing and accounting issues should probably be investigated by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), a private-sector oversight operation.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s where the problem develops: Comcast learned where Conal was employed. It just happened to be a company that does business with Comcast.</p>
<p>Consumerist reports that Conal claims he never named the company when he was on the phone with various customer service reps &#x2014; he believes Comcast must&#x2019;ve looked up the information somehow. Nonetheless:</p>
<blockquote><p>At some point shortly after that call, someone from Comcast contacted a partner at the firm to discuss Conal. This led to an ethics investigation and Conal&#x2019;s subsequent dismissal from his job; a job where he says he&#x2019;d only received positive feedback and reviews for his work.</p>
<p>When he was fired, Conal&#x2019;s employer explained that the reason for the dismissal<strong> was an e-mail from Comcast that summarized conversations between Conal and Comcast employees.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Emphasis added.</p>
<p>Consumerist, never a Comcast-friendly publication to begin with, seethes:</p>
<p>&#x201C;I think whether or not Conal mentioned his employer is beside the point. The problem should not have reached the point where he was even reaching out the Comcast Controller&#x2019;s office,&#x201D; writer Chris Moran says. &#x201C;Had the billing issues been fixed on the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth chance that he gave Comcast to address the issue, the call in question would never have happened. &#xA0;And even if Conal did identify his employer in the hope of getting his billing issue fixed, he wouldn&#x2019;t have been trying to get preferential treatment; just the service he&#x2019;d paid for.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Comcast told Consumerist it &#x201C;will&#xA0;review (Conal&#x2019;s)&#xA0;lawyer&#x2019;s letter and respond as quickly as possible.&#x201D;</p> </div> <p class=""entry-tags"">Read More About: <a href=""http://www.phillymag.com/tag/comcast/"">Comcast</a></p> </article><div id=""text-29"" class=""widget_text""> <div class=""textwidget""><p>Be respectful of our online community and contribute to an engaging conversation.

Instead, Comcast sent him to collections in February.</p><p>And this is where Conal made the call that allegedly cost him his job.

He spoke to someone in that office who promised Conal would receive a call back to address the issues.</p><p>He describes that callback as &quot;bizarre,&quot; with the rep not identifying which company she was calling from, just starting out with &quot;How can I help you?&quot; Then she kept insisting that a technician had shown up for an appointment, but wouldn&apos;t specify which appointment. The rep then began asking him for the color of his house.</p><p>So he tried the Controller&apos;s office again, to let them know that the rep they&apos;d sent his way had failed miserably at her job.</p></blockquote><p>Considering that even Comcast acknowledges its customer service experience is so broken that <a href=""http://gawker.com/comcast-well-try-to-stop-fucking-you-but-it-may-take-1640348300"">it could take years to reform</a>, you can hardly blame a customer who understands corporate structures for escalating his complaint. </p><aside class=""link-preview""><a href=""http://gawker.com/comcast-well-try-to-stop-fucking-you-but-it-may-take-1640348300""><p>After a string of high profile customer service cock-ups, Comcast has put an executive in charge of &#x2026;</p></a></aside><p>Comcast did blame Conal, though.

<p><em><strong>Update, Oct. 8, 11 a.m.:</strong> Ars Technica <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/10/comcast-got-me-fired-after-billing-dispute-says-california-man/"">confirmed the account</a> described in this story over lunch last Friday with the man, Conal O&apos;Rourke, in Northern California. O&apos;Rourke was fired from his job at PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC) earlier this year after his extended dispute with Comcast. Ars Technica reports that he provided &quot;an astonishing amount of documentation&quot; and is threatening to sue Comcast if the company does not apologize, retract its comments to his employer, restore his job, and pay him $100,312.50 by Oct. 14.<br>
 </em></p>


</div>


<div class=""text-2 text parbase section"">

<p><em>Innovative</em> might not be the first word that comes to mind in describing Comcast. But are we giving the company credit where credit is due? Let&apos;s face it, after that harrowing <a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/07/15/comcast_rep_refuses_to_cancel_service_listen_to_the_customer_service_call.html"">18-minute customer service call</a> went viral in July, it looked like Comcast had nothing more to strive for&#x2014;it had reached peak horrible. Yet if reports this week are accurate, Comcast has continued to shine as an innovator in the competitive field of corporate terribleness: It got a customer&apos;s employer to fire him for complaining about shoddy customer service.</p>


</div>







<div class=""text-3 text parbase section"">

<p>The <a href=""http://consumerist.com/2014/10/06/unhappy-customer-comcast-told-my-employer-about-complaint-got-me-fired/"">full story in all its sadistic glory is at <em>Consumerist</em></a><em>,</em> but here&apos;s the SparkNotes version. A customer named &quot;Conal&quot; started subscribing to Comcast service in early 2013. There were issues: erroneous charges, bills that never arrived, discounts that weren&apos;t applied. Conal considered canceling his service, but decided to stick with it after a Comcast rep promised that the issues would be resolved and threw in some free perks. As another friendly gesture, the company also allegedly sent and billed Conal for $1,820 of equipment he&apos;d never ordered.</p>


</div>








<div class=""text parbase text-4 section"">

<p>This is where it gets crazy. Conal, understandably frustrated, decided to bypass the customer service department and take his complaints straight to the Comcast controller. During the call, he claims, he suggested that a private-sector oversight group look into Comcast&apos;s billing and accounting issues. Shortly after that call, Comcast contacted Conal&apos;s employer&#x2014;a large accounting firm that <a href=""http://consumerist.com/2014/10/06/unhappy-customer-comcast-told-my-employer-about-complaint-got-me-fired/""><em>Consumerist</em> reports</a> happened to do business with Comcast. The rep claimed that Conal had name-dropped his employer as leverage during the call; according to the story, the firm opened an investigation against Conal and then fired him from his job.</p>


</div>














<div class=""text parbase text-5 section"">

<p>It&apos;s hard to know who&apos;s telling the truth here. Conal <a href=""http://consumerist.com/2014/10/06/unhappy-customer-comcast-told-my-employer-about-complaint-got-me-fired/"">tells <em>Consumerist</em></a> that he never mentioned his employer and that someone at Comcast must have looked him up to figure out where he worked. Comcast, for its part, has allegedly refused to release any tapes of the phone calls it made on the matter. That&apos;s a little strange: If Conal did invoke his company&apos;s name in a threatening way, Comcast could easily prove as much by excerpting the relevant portion of his call. So much for monitoring &quot;for quality assurance purposes.&quot; If you want it done right, <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/comcast-admits-it-issues-refunds-if-you-record-calls-2014-8"">record the call yourself</a>.<br>

While those charges were removed after his complaint, his account still ended up with<strong> </strong>a collections agency last February. </p> <p> O&apos;Rourke<strong> </strong>told the CNN that he contacted Comcast&apos;s corporate office. &quot;I had a pleasant initial conversation,&quot; he said. &quot;From there it went bad.

<p>OAKLAND, CA&#x2014;Speaking over lunch last Friday, a Northern California man named Conal O&apos;Rourke laid out what admittedly sounds like a crazy story: a year-long billing dispute over his home Comcast service that ultimately resulted in Comcast getting O&apos;Rourke fired from his job at <a href=""http://www.pwc.com/"">PriceWaterhouseCoopers</a> (PWC) in nearby San Jose earlier this year.</p>
<p>But O&#x2019;Rourke arrived to last week&#x2019;s lunch meeting with Ars with an astonishing amount of documentation: he has pages and pages of Comcast invoices. He has a spreadsheet, photos, notes, business cards, and complaint letters. He and his lawyer, <a href=""http://www.dhillonlaw.com/ryan"">Maureen Pettibone Ryan</a>, happily provided digital copies of these materials to Ars, which we have re-published with his permission here.</p>
<p>As a result of his firing, O&#x2019;Rourke has hired a local attorney and is now threatening to file a lawsuit against Comcast if the company does not agree to his <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1309785-20141002-orourke-reply-letter-final.html"">demands</a>, which include &quot;a full retraction and apology, his re-employment with his former employer, and $100,312.50&quot; by October 14.</p>
<h2>A rogue $26.25</h2>
<p>O&#x2019;Rourke first moved to California in early 2012 after 20 years of working for Andersen Consulting (later Accenture) in Connecticut, most recently as part of the corporate controllership division. During his career, O&apos;Rourke developed skills in accounting, financial analysis, and auditing&#x2014;skills that proved useful in his eventual dispute with Comcast.</p>
<p>In February 2013, he moved to a new place in San Jose and signed up for TV and Internet service with Comcast, since the only other competitive service, AT&amp;T&#x2019;s U-Verse, was not available in his building.</p>
<p>&quot;I was roped into Comcast, and with Comcast, my problems soon began,&quot; O&apos;Rourke said.</p>
<p>His first issues began when, after six weeks of service, he had yet to receive a bill.</p>
<p>After eventually&#xA0;receiving his <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1309776-account-invoices.html"">first bill</a> in April 2013, O&apos;Rourke noticed a number of problems. For one thing, his name was misspelled (an issue that never got corrected).</p>
<p>More importantly, O&#x2019;Rourke noticed that Comcast was charging him for three <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1309776-account-invoices.html#document/p55/a181277"">&quot;additional HD outlets&quot; for an extra fee of $26.25</a>&#xA0;a month. He also was charged for cable boxes that he says he never activated (he planned on moving two additional TVs later on into his condominium), after allegedly being promised that he wouldn&#x2019;t be.</p>
<p>Finally, as part of a promotional deal, O&apos;Rourke says he was promised HBO and other premium channels for nine months, but they disappeared after just three.</p>
<p>O&#x2019;Rourke said he called multiple times to try to get these issues resolved. When they weren&#x2019;t, he finally walked into his nearest Comcast store in San Jose.</p>
<p>There he met with the assistant store manager, who gave him a business card and provided his personal cellphone number. &quot;He promises me that it will all be addressed and that we&apos;re going to look at it,&quot; O&#x2019;Rourke said.</p>
<p>Then the real problems began.</p>
<h2>$1,820 in equipment he didn&apos;t order</h2>
<p>For the next few months, O&#x2019;Rourke says he was under deadlines at work and could not address issues with Comcast.</p>
<p>By October 2013, O&#x2019;Rourke said that his Internet speeds suddenly dropped off, becoming &quot;unworkable.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I had contacted them regarding lack of responsiveness and performance issues; sometimes my service wouldn&apos;t be usable and I had to hotspot in with AT&amp;T,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Again he called, and again, Comcast promised to correct his problem&#x2014;sometimes by sending technicians to his home&#x2014;but according to O&apos;Rourke, the company never did.</p>
<p>O&#x2019;Rourke spent part of November and December 2013 traveling overseas, so he was surprised when he returned home to find several boxes at his doorstep containing &quot;12 pieces of equipment&quot; and a <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1309776-account-invoices.html#document/p55/a181277"">December 2013 monthly bill for over $2,000&#x2014;including $1,820 in equipment that he insists he did not order</a>.</p>
<p>According to the December 2013 invoice, O&#x2019;Rourke was charged for devices including an &quot;AnyRoom Hub&quot; ($420) and a &quot;Pace Host&quot; ($110). On December 30, 2013, carrying these various boxes back, O&apos;Rourke walked into the same San Jose Comcast store to return the gear and get his issues resolved.</p>
<p>When he took a service ticket at 1:59pm, he discovered that he was Ticket #395&#xA0;but&#xA0;that the store was only on Ticket #251. Rather than spend his afternoon at the store, O&#x2019;Rourke came up with a plan.</p>
<p>&quot;They close at 7:00pm, so I thought, I&apos;m going to go at 6:45pm, then somebody will have a fire underneath them to address the problems,&quot; he said. &quot;I had had it up to here.&quot;</p>

<p>A Comcast employee named Matt Doblias ended up helping O&#x2019;Rourke, took back the equipment, and cleared the charges. But that still didn&#x2019;t get to the root of the errors that had now persisted for months. (Ars sent an e-mail to Doblias, which bounced.)</p>
<p>&quot;I provided Matt with the <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1309772-gmail-account-reconciliation.html"">detailed spreadsheet</a> in person, and he asked if I could send it to him, and he would take a look,&quot; O&#x2019;Rourke said. The next day, December 31, he did so, but Doblias &quot;responded that the spreadsheet never came through. I sent it again, then at the end of the day I asked for follow up and never heard back.&quot;</p>
<p>O&#x2019;Rourke got irritated.</p>
<p>&quot;On January 11, 2014, I was frustrated because I felt that I had done everything,&quot; he said. &quot;I sent [Doblias] an e-mail that I was hopeful would ignite him to do something. What I did was [show Doblias by e-mail that] I sarcastically wrote a letter [to Comcast Senior Vice President Lawrence Salva], <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1309773-gmail-electronic-copy-mr-lawrence-j-salva.html"">recommending Doblias for the Employee of the Month award</a>. I wrote it up but didn&apos;t put it in the mail. I wanted to give [Doblias] an opportunity to fix the problem.&quot;</p>
<p>The letter included lines like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class=""DV-textContents"">The reason why I have chosen to nominate the San Jose center is simple. Their blatant disregard for the customer has made resolving my issues next to impossible. This behavior has proven to be quite profitable as I, like most customers, just throw their hands up in exasperation. However, now that I am no longer exasperated I intend on following up on my concerns.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But&#xA0;O&apos;Rourke heard nothing, and the billing errors persisted&#x2014;resulting in Comcast allegedly sending a collections agency after him.</p>
<p>&quot;On February 5, 2014, [Comcast] said my account was two months past due and at that <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1309776-account-invoices.html#document/p62/a181280"">point pushing $300</a>,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&apos;t order pay-per-view, and I explained [to the collections agency] that that can&apos;t be right, and they were insistent, and I walked them through it.&quot;</p>
<p><blockquote class=""pullquote right""><div class=""pullquote-content"">She said, &#x2018;What color is your house?!? Tell me the color of your house!&#x2019; She went on a tirade and said, &#x2018;Just answer the&#xA0;question!&#x2019;</div></blockquote>By this point, O&#x2019;Rourke had yet to receive an errorless bill, he said, despite having been a customer for nearly a year. The following day, he decided to contact <a href=""http://corporate.comcast.com/news-information/leadership-overview/lawrence-j-salva"">Lawrence Salva</a>, Comcast&#x2019;s Philadelphia-based controller, who oversees the division of the company that deals with accounting. He spoke at length with Salva&#x2019;s executive assistant, describing his litany of problems. After the call concluded, the assistant said that she would have another Comcast employee contact O&#x2019;Rourke directly.</p>
<p>&quot;An hour later I got a second call from an individual who doesn&apos;t identify herself [except as Evelyn] but says that she&apos;s with Comcast,&quot; he said. O&#x2019;Rourke asked her if she knew why she was calling, to which she responded that it had something to do with missed appointments.</p>
<p>&quot;I laughed, because they missed so many appointments I don&apos;t even know which one she&apos;s talking about,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>When he tried to explain the situation, O&apos;Rourke said that Evelyn began to berate him.</p>
<p>&quot;She said, &#x2018;What color is your house?!? Tell me the color of your house!&#x2019;&quot; O&#x2019;Rourke remembered. &quot;She went on a tirade and said, &#x2018;Just answer the question!&#x2019;&quot; (O&apos;Rourke lives in a condo complex.)</p>
<p>&quot;I told her that I was angry and said, &#x2018;You need to do your homework before you pick up the phone,&#x2019;&quot; he told Ars. &quot;I told her I was going to call back to Salva&apos;s office. That&apos;s what I did. And I expressed my concern and said, &apos;You have sloppy accounting, you don&apos;t take anything seriously, and I should go to the <a href=""http://pcaobus.org/"">Public Company Accounting Oversight Board</a>.&apos; That&apos;s the regulator that makes sure that accounting is done properly. I think that some of my terminology would have indicated that I wasn&apos;t a layman. I worked for 20 years in corporate comptrollership. These errors become material after a while.&quot;</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to O&#x2019;Rourke, however, his call set off alarm bells within Comcast.</p> <p><em>Listing image by <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/alykat/115643524/in/photolist-bdGMS-5q2Yzy-7axde-7avLZ-7axhE-7avQf-2Espi-PBBt-6o2Azu-6fa8js-5HoCCA-dRQr9b-KNEAf-KNNnV-KNGMb-KNENG-KNFBf-KNEEb-KNEJJ-KNh9Q-KNxur-KNqbM-KNFpw-KNtdp-KNe8W-KNuyp-KNjZf-KNBEw-KNfvC-KNfS5-KND4j-KNGx1-KNfd7-KNrnX-KNsBM-KNiYW-KNvoz-KNgU1-KNQAM-KNBo5-KNSoZ-KNuuD-KNuJV-KNqVB-KNqHF-KNt4B-KNdYb-KNAcG-KNj4E-KNfhs"">Alyson Hurt</a></em></p> </div><hr><h4>Page 2</h4><div class=""article-content post-page""> <p>According to O&apos;Rourke, someone within Salva&#x2019;s office immediately began conducting Internet research on him&#xA0;and determined that he was a PWC employee. (According to Salva&apos;s <a href=""http://corporate.comcast.com/news-information/leadership-overview/lawrence-j-salva"">bio</a>, before joining Comcast in 2000 he was &quot;a partner with PricewaterhouseCoopers&#xA0;for over 12 years.&quot;) A letter written by O&apos;Rourke&apos;s lawyer describes what allegedly happened next:</p>
<blockquote><p>Because Comcast was a major consulting services client of PWC&#x2019;s, someone from the Controller&#x2019;s office contacted Mr. Joseph Atkinson, a partner in the Philadelphia office of PWC, and falsely told Mr. Atkinson that Mr. O&#x2019;Rourke had invoked his employment with PWC in an attempt to somehow obtain leverage in his negotiations with Comcast. Mr. Atkinson informed Mr. O&#x2019;Rourke that the client was very valuable, was the Philadelphia office&#x2019;s largest client with billings [REDACTED], that the client was very angry as a result of Mr. O&#x2019;Rourke&#x2019;s complaints, and that Mr. O&#x2019;Rourke was not to speak with anyone from Comcast. While all of this was happening, Comcast continued to communicate sporadically and ineffectively with Mr. O&#x2019;Rourke, setting up two service appointments that they missed without explanation on February 7, 2014 and February 11, 2014.</p></blockquote>
<p>O&apos;Rourke says that on February 7, 2014, he was subjected to an internal PWC ethics investigation as a result of the call. On February 18, O&apos;Rourke was terminated. O&apos;Rourke&apos;s letter says that he was &quot;shocked, humiliated and ashamed based on the unjustified loss of his job. He sought counseling and was prescribed medication to address his emotional distress.&quot;</p>
<p>O&#x2019;Rourke told me that his firing came as a complete shock. &quot;I was totally taken aback,&quot; he said. &quot;I was numb. I was absolutely numb.&quot;</p>
<p>On March 10, 2014, O&#x2019;Rourke finally cut all ties to Comcast.</p>
<p>&quot;I begged AT&amp;T to give me service, and they did&#x2014;it only took a week,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>On July 28, O&apos;Rourke&apos;s lawyer, Maureen Ryan, sent an <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310811-20140728-orourke-demand-letter.html"">initial demand letter</a> to Comcast. On August 18, Comcast&#x2019;s senior deputy corporate counsel, Thomas Nathan, <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1309769-20140821-orourke-conal-response-to-demand-letter.html"">responded</a> to Ryan, telling her that Comcast had not received Ryan&apos;s letter in time to meet her deadline for action. So Ryan sent a second letter.</p>
<p>(Nathan&apos;s response letter does acknowledge that &quot;Comcast communicated to PWC that a person claiming to be a PWC employee had called our&#xA0;chief accounting executive&apos;s office with complaints about his cable service and bills, and yelled&#xA0;at our employees who tried to assist him.&quot; But Nathan asserts those statements were &quot;neither untrue nor unprivileged.&#xA0;As such, they cannot be defamatory. Comcast unequivocally denies your assertion that it&#xA0;requested PWC to fire Mr. O&apos;Rourke.&quot;)</p>
<p>As the <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1309785-20141002-orourke-reply-letter-final.html"">new demand letter states</a>, O&apos;Rourke wants $100,000 in compensation&#x2014;and he wants to return to his old post at PWC in San Jose. Why ask Comcast about a job at PWC? Because, Ryan tells Ars, PWC believed Comcast, and &quot;we didn&apos;t feel that contacting them would do any good until Comcast retracted their defamation, or until we get the tapes through litigation.&quot;</p>
<p>Comcast declined to respond to specific questions about O&#x2019;Rourke&#x2019;s case, with a company spokesman saying only that &quot;our customers deserve the best experience every time they interact with us. We have previously apologized to Mr. O&#x2019;Rourke, but we will review his lawyer&#x2019;s letter and respond as quickly as possible.&quot;</p>
<p>PWC spokeswoman Caroline Nolan did not respond to questions at the time of publication.</p>
<h2>&quot;Totally egregious&quot;</h2>
<p>In the months since his firing, O&#x2019;Rourke has discovered the numerous public complaints against Comcast&#x2014;which have only enraged him further.</p>
<p>&quot;I think they&apos;re totally egregious,&quot; O&#x2019;Rourke told Ars. &quot;I think they&apos;re the most unethical, dishonest bunch that I&apos;ve ever encountered. I would like to see them investigated for repeated overbilling. It is a very common occurrence.&quot;</p>
<p>In September 2014, he even went as far as sending a <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1309777-copy-of-blumenthal-as-sent-to-comcast.html"">10-page letter to Sen. Richard Blumenthal</a> (D-CT), detailing not only his story but articulating his deep concerns about Comcast&#x2019;s practices on a broader scale.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that they need to be made aware of how they conduct business, and, most importantly, I think that the consumer needs to be protected, and protection is not going to come in the form of them gobbling up somebody else [like Time Warner Cable],&quot; O&apos;Rourke said. &quot;That&apos;s not what&apos;s going to happen. If I was not able to convince AT&amp;T to provide service, I would be left without anything. I feel that they [Comcast] are a bully. They used their money to unfair advantage&#x2014;that is just absolutely wrong. There&apos;s a flagrant disregard for how they conduct themselves.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE, Wednesday Oct. 8:&#xA0;</strong>In an e-mail sent to Ars, PWC spokeswoman Nolan did not respond to specific questions but did send a statement. &quot;Mr. O&#x2019;Rourke was employed in one of our internal firm services offices,&quot; she wrote. &quot;The firm terminated his employment after an internal investigation concluded that Mr. O&#x2019;Rourke violated PwC&#x2019;s ethical standards and practices, applicable to all of our people. The firm has explicit policies regarding employee conduct, we train our people in those policies, and we enforce them. Mr. O&#x2019;Rourke&#x2019;s violation of these policies was the sole reason for his termination.&quot;</p>
<p>Later in the day, Comcast issued a <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/10/comcast-treatment-of-upset-former-customer-completely-unacceptable/"">public apology on its company blog</a>&#xA0;(written by&#xA0;Charlie Herrin, a company senior vice president). The company called its treatment of O&apos;Rourke &quot;completely unacceptable&quot; and noted, &quot;We also want to clarify that nobody at Comcast asked for him to be fired.&quot; O&apos;Rourke&apos;s lawyer Ryan responded to the statement, expressing disappointment at what her client viewed as a somewhat hollow apology. She reiterated that O&apos;Rourke&apos;s Oct. 14 deadline for Comcast to meet his demands&#x2014;or expect a lawsuit&#x2014;still stands.</p> </div>",arstechnica.com,,2335

                                <p>Many of today&#x2019;s modern customer service departments are notorious for leaving customers with anything but service. Phone calls lead to recorded run-arounds that resolve nothing while wasting the customer&#x2019;s time. If a live customer service representative is actually reached, they may cheerily declare a customer&#x2019;s problem solved, only for said customer to later find out that their problem is still alive and well. And sometimes companies have insulated themselves so well against customer complaints that the customer is simply left to pound sand.</p>
<p>But a company that will get you fired from your job for complaining to them? Ladies and Gentlemen, please welcome, Comcast!</p>
<p>While definitely not <a href=""http://www.inquisitr.com/1504720/comcast-home-security-customer-service/"">Comcast&#x2019;s</a> first trip to the bad customer service rodeo, this latest case may trump all others, with Comcast getting a guy named Conal fired from his company following ongoing problems he was having with Comcast, reports the <a href=""http://consumerist.com/2014/10/06/unhappy-customer-comcast-told-my-employer-about-complaint-got-me-fired/""><em>Consumerist</em></a>.</p>
<p>Conal, an employee with a prominent accounting firm, received wrong products, extra products he didn&#x2019;t request or need, wrong bills, and unwarranted bills &#x2013; in other words a virtual blizzard of frustrating gaffes by Comcast that he could not get resolved through Comcast customer service. So, he went above their heads to the Comcast powers that be, including their controller.</p>
<p>An unforeseen conflict that Conal didn&#x2019;t recognize, however, is that his company did business with Comcast. One of the higher ups at Comcast did see this though, and headed back over to Conal&#x2019;s employer apparently intent on turning Conal&#x2019;s complaints to Comcast against him.</p>
<p>This obviously influential Comcast executive had discussions about Conal with one of the partners in Conal&#x2019;s company, and Conal got the boot shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>Conal says he&#x2019;d only ever received positive reviews for his work, but the company claims he tried to use their name to get leverage in his dispute with Comcast. Conal maintains he did no such thing and can only surmise that someone from Comcast did some online sleuthing and figured out the connection with where he worked. This seemingly allowed Comcast to do some leveraging of their own to get Conal fired for daring to complain about their services.</p>
<p>In the end, Conal&#x2019;s employer says they fired him based on an email from Comcast that gave an overview of Conal&#x2019;s alleged wrongdoings via his interactions with Comcast employees.</p>
<p>Conal, meanwhile, says he&#x2019;s never been allowed to see that email to check its veracity, and Comcast won&#x2019;t release any documentation they have regarding his situation, either.</p>
<p>So, now stuck in a literal corporate nightmare, beneath both his own disloyal, former company and Comcast, Conal is left with little recourse, though he has retained a lawyer that has reportedly been in touch with Comcast.</p>
<p>The old adage about the customer always being right certainly doesn&#x2019;t seem to hold any water in Conal&#x2019;s dealings with Comcast.</p>
<p>But <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/man-claims-comcast-called-boss-112232265.html""><em>Business Insider</em></a> reports that, as also mentioned above, Conal isn&#x2019;t the first victim of Comcast&#x2019;s alleged less-than-stellar customer service.</p>

Yet, if reports this week are accurate, Comcast has continued to shine as an innovator in the competitive field of corporate terribleness: It got a customer&#x2019;s employer to fire him for complaining about shoddy customer service.</p><p>The <a href=""http://consumerist.com/2014/10/06/unhappy-customer-comcast-told-my-employer-about-complaint-got-me-fired/"">full story in all its sadistic glory is at <i>Consumerist</i></a>, but here&#x2019;s the SparkNotes version. A customer named &#x201C;Conal&#x201D; started subscribing to Comcast service in early 2013. There were issues: erroneous charges, bills that never arrived, discounts that weren&#x2019;t applied. Conal considered cancelling his service, but decided to stick with it after a Comcast rep promised that the issues would be resolved and threw in some free perks. As another friendly gesture, the company also allegedly sent and billed Conal for $1,820 of equipment he&#x2019;d never ordered.</p><div class=""module image-module module-image-650w366h""><div class=""module-content""><div class=""image-block image-650w366h""><div class=""image-frame""><img alt=""The Comcast Center in Philadelphia &#x2014; where the magic happens."" src=""http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/7d3a370d7b8f83876aabc33022279280"" width=""650""></div><p class=""caption""><span class=""caption-text"">The Comcast Center in Philadelphia &#x2014; where the magic happens.</span><span class=""image-source""><em>Source:</em>Getty Images</span></p></div></div></div><p>This is where it gets crazy. Conal, understandably frustrated, decided to bypass the customer service department and take his complaints straight to the Comcast controller. During the call, he claims, he suggested that a private-sector oversight group look into Comcast&#x2019;s billing and accounting issues. Shortly after that call, Comcast contacted Conal&#x2019;s employer &#x2014; a large accounting firm that <i>Consumerist </i>reports happened to do business with Comcast. The rep claimed that Conal had name-dropped his employer as leverage during the call; according to the story, the firm opened an investigation against Conal and then fired him from his job.</p><p>It&#x2019;s hard to know who&#x2019;s telling the truth here. Conal tells <i>Consumerist </i>that he never mentioned his employer and that someone at Comcast must have looked him up to figure out where he worked. Comcast, for its part, has allegedly refused to release any tapes of the phone calls it made on the matter. That&#x2019;s a little strange: If Conal did invoke his company&#x2019;s name in a threatening way, Comcast could easily prove as much by excerpting the relevant portion of his call.

In more bad PR for Comcast, the company allegedly got an unhappy customer fired from his job.</div><br>
</p>
<p><font class=""copyright_text_color_g""><b>Origins:</b></font> &#xA0; On <nobr>6 October</nobr> 2014, consumer advocacy blog <i>Consumerist</i></p>
<p>published an article in which former PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) employee Conal O&#x2019;Rourke alleged cable provider Comcast retaliated against him professionally over a business dispute. According to the blog and O&#x2019;Rourke, Comcast&#x2019;s interference led to the man&#x2019;s termination from the firm.</p>
<p>O&#x2019;Rourke gave a detailed timeline of his dealings with Comcast during the course of the post, explaining that he became a reluctant customer of the cable provider in early 2013. O&#x2019;Rourke admitted that his relationship with Comcast quickly degraded, leading to a series of adversarial interactions and a billing dispute with the provider.</p>
<p><i>Consumerist</i> quoted O&#x2019;Rourke&#x2019;s description of a &#x201C;bizarre&#x201D; call with a person he believed to be a Comcast rep. Shortly thereafter, O&#x2019;Rourke was fired from his job as described by the blog:</p>
<p><font class=""quote_font""><br>
<div class=""quote_style""><br>
At some point shortly after that call, someone from Comcast contacted a partner at the firm to discuss Conal. This led to an ethics investigation and Conal&#x2019;s subsequent dismissal from his job; a job where he says he&#x2019;d only received positive feedback and reviews for his work.</div></font></p>
<p>Comcast maintained that Conal used the name of his employer in an attempt to get leverage. Conal insists that he never mentioned his employer by name, but believes that someone in the Comcast Controller&#x2019;s office looked him up online and figured out where he worked.</p>
<p>When he was fired, Conal&#x2019;s employer explained that the reason for the dismissal was an <nobr>e-mail</nobr> from Comcast that summarized conversations between Conal and Comcast employees.<br>
</p></div><br> <p><i>Ars Technica</i> reached out to PwC for comment on the situation involving Comcast and Conal O&#x2019;Rourke, and PwC spokeswoman Caroline Nolan replied with a statement via <nobr>e-mail</nobr> that acknowledged O&#x2019;Rourke had been terminated over an ethics issue but provided no other details:</p>
<p><font class=""quote_font""><br>
<div class=""quote_style""><br>
Mr. O&#x2019;Rourke was employed in one of our internal firm services offices. The firm terminated his employment after an internal investigation concluded that <nobr>Mr. O&#x2019;Rourke</nobr> violated PwC&#x2019;s ethical standards and practices, applicable to all of our people. The firm has explicit policies regarding employee conduct, we train our people in those policies, and we enforce them. <nobr>Mr. O&#x2019;Rourke&#x2019;s</nobr> violation of these policies was the sole reason for his termination.<br>
</div><br>
</font></p>
<p>On 8 October 2014, Charlie Herrin, Senior Vice President of Customer Experience at Comcast Cable, issued a public apology to O&#x2019;Rourke in a post to <i><a href=""http://corporate.comcast.com/comcast-voices/a-public-apology-to-conal-orourke"">Comcast Voices</a></i>. In that statement, Herrin admitted to a lapse in customer service in the overall handling of O&#x2019;Rourke&#x2019;s issues but denied that anyone representing Comcast requested he be terminated from PwC. Herrin did resolve to investigate precisely how the entire situation escalated so severely:</p>
<p><font class=""quote_font""><br>
<div class=""quote_style""><br>
What happened with Mr. O&#x2019;Rourke&#x2019;s service is completely unacceptable. Despite our attempts to address <nobr>Mr. O&#x2019;Rourke&#x2019;s</nobr> issues, we simply dropped the ball and did not make things right. <nobr>Mr. O&#x2019;Rourke</nobr> deserves another apology from us and we&#x2019;re making this one publicly. We also want to clarify that nobody at Comcast asked for him to be fired.</div></font></p>
<p>We&#x2019;re also determined to get to the bottom of exactly what happened with his service, figure out what went wrong at every point along the way, and fix any underlying issues. I&#x2019;m a few weeks into a new role at Comcast which is entirely focused on what we can do to make the customer experience better. We need to make sure that every interaction is excellent from the moment a customer orders a new service, to the installation, to the way we communicate with them, to how we respond to any issues. </p>
<p>We&#x2019;re holding ourselves accountable and we are working hard to make real improvements across the board. While it will take us some time, we can and will do better than this.<br>

<p>A man says Comcast contacted his employer and got him fired after he called to complain about the company&apos;s service.&#xA0;</p> <p><a href=""http://consumerist.com/2014/10/06/unhappy-customer-comcast-told-my-employer-about-complaint-got-me-fired/"">The Consumerist reports that a man known as Conal complained to Comcast</a>&#xA0;after he was billed for services he didn&apos;t actually have. After Conal&apos;s complaint, the company promised him extra television channels as a make-good but instead sent him a variety of equipment he didn&apos;t need.&#xA0;</p> <p>Conal complained to Comcast again after he was billed $1,820 for the surplus hardware. This is where things get interesting. Conal, who says he works for a large American accountancy firm, compiled a spreadsheet showing every erroneous charge he had received from Comcast, which he sent to the company.</p> <p>Comcast then apparently refused to reverse the error, so in February 2014, Conal decided to try something else. Being an accountant, Conal contacted Comcast&apos;s comptroller, the office that looks after the company accounts.

Ultimately, Mr. O&apos;Rourke convinced the postal service to deliver mail to him that was addressed to &quot;Mr. O&apos;Kourke,&quot; after he was unable to convince Comcast to even correct the spelling of his name. </p></blockquote><blockquote><p> In addition to Comcast&apos;s continual failure to address Mr. O&apos;Rourke&apos;s billing issues, in late November or early December of 2013, when Mr. O&apos;Rourke was out of town, Comcast shipped Mr. O&apos;Rourke twelve random pieces of Comcast equipment. Comcast then proceeded to charge Mr. O&apos;Rourke almost $2,000 in fees for equipment that he had neither requested nor wanted. </p></blockquote><p> When he tried to get help with these issues, he says, Comcast sent him to collections. That&apos;s when he took his complaint directly to the controller, and allegedly lost his job as a result. He says he never received a single correct bill in the entire year he was a Comcast customer.</p><p> Although O&apos;Rourke originally said he would sue to get his job back, the complaint simply asks for legal fees and damages&#x2014;i.e., the lost wages from the six months he&apos;s been unemployed&#x2014;and an injunction stopping The Worst Company in America from overbilling customers. </p><p> Good luck with that last part.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> Here&apos;s Comcast&apos;s response, sent to me via email:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;We don&apos;t normally comment on pending litigation and as we have said, there were clear deficiencies in the customer service that we delivered to Mr. O&apos;Rourke. Comcast had nothing to do with PricewaterhouseCoopers&apos; decision to terminate Mr. O&apos;Rourke. Once again, we apologize to Mr. O&apos;Rourke for his service issues. We said we were determined to get to the bottom of exactly what happened with Mr. O&apos;Rourke&apos;s service and we are doing that. As part of this investigation, we have listened to recorded calls between Mr. O&apos;Rourke and our customer service representatives and his treatment of them and his language is totally unspeakable. Mr. O&apos;Rourke&apos;s claims are without merit.&quot;<br></p></blockquote> </div>",gawker.com,,575

It&apos;s unknown whether Samsung customers are also experiencing hair loss when taking calls on their phones, as some iPhone 6 users are now reporting.&#xA0;

<p>Apple is fielding yet another consumer complaint as users add Hairgate stories, to a list of iPhone 6 problems. In addition to the controversy over the phone&#x2019;s reported tendency to bend, and the debacle over iOS 8, Apple is now being targeting for the iPhone 6&#x2019;s supposed random habit of pulling out users hair, both from the head and the beard. Apple has always claimed the device is a smartphone, but one has to question the need for the ability to pull-off such a feat.</p>
<p>The problem seems to occur due to what users believe is a small seam between the iPhone 6&#x2019;s metal casing and the glass screen. Although the situation has not turned into an epidemic, and has not stopped people lining up to buy the device, it does seem to be creating a large amount of conversation on Social Media sites such as Facebook and Twitter.</p>
<p>Hairgate has its own Facebook page on which users are commenting on, and sharing images of hairs caught in Apple&#x2019;s trap; a device which measures a petite 138.1 x 67 x 6.9 mm. Twitter has also joined the party with dozens of users regularly tweeting comments about personal experiences and links to internet articles. Twitter user Muttly_is tweeted, &#x201C;No longer the hairy dog I once was thanks to the plucking iPhone 6 relieving me of my ear fur. Ouch! Owooo!&#x201D;, and mooretobyneeded tweeted, &#x201C;Had a nice shave with my iPhone 6 this morning&#x2026;&#x201D; So far there doesn&#x2019;t appear to be an official response from Apple about the Hairgate scandal, and a quick search of their website found no matching results.</p>
<p>However it is not all bad news, as the team from GottaBeMobile said in their article discussing iPhone 6 users&#x2019; claims that Hairgate has added to Apple&#x2019;s problems. &#x201C;Frankly, it hasn&#x2019;t happened to any of us&#x2026;&#x201D; they wrote. Other sites are also supporting the &#x201C;no-pull&#x201D; side of the debate by trying to dispel myth with fact. A recent article on Forbes said &#x201C;&#x2026;it&#x2019;s nonsense.&#x201D; According to Forbes contributor Gordon Kelly, the gap between the front glass and the aluminum casing does not exist. &#x201C;There is a bevel, but the glass front panel is actually fused to the aluminium and the tiny gap you do see is significantly narrower than a human hair,&#x201D; Kelly wrote. Kelly goes on to discuss the Samsung Galaxy Note 4, which was branded with the label &#x201C;Gapgate&#x201D; due to an actual gap in the tablet&#x2019;s seam, yet survived without &#x201C;widespread reports of hair trauma.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Many people cannot resist the opportunity to make a joke of an issue that sounds too ludicrous to be taken seriously, and the internet is a perfect audience. However most internet users have the ability to be wary and decide for themselves if a photo or video is genuine, or simply created to demonstrate an idea. iPhone 6 and Twitter user JustAlly tweeted, &#x201C;I have big curly hair that gets caught in EVERYTHING, and it has never been caught in my iPhone 6. I say hairgate was started by Samsung.&#x201D; When read together with other comments suggesting it is a covert DNA sourcing operation, it is hard to believe either suggestion.</p>
<p>Numerous news articles and Social Media comments about users&#x2019; problems with Apple&#x2019;s iPhone 6 have surfaced since its release last month, and Hairgate has been successfully added. That does not necessarily mean the end of iPhone&#x2019;s popularity on the market. Mashable also disputes the complaints with a video showing people rubbing the iPhone 6 on their hair and beards. &#x201C;We&#x2019;ve gone with beards and curly hair and long hair, short hair, your hair, my hair,&#x201D; reporter Christina Warren said in the video. &#x201C;Hairgate is not a thing,&#x201D; Warren said. Perhaps Hairgate is simply a clever rumour created by Apple to encourage people to buy it and try it, after all, the saying goes that &#x201C;any publicity is good publicity.&#x201D;</p>

          <div class=""content"">It appears that there may be a serious bug with the &quot;Reset All Settings&quot; option in iOS 8, causing users who activate the feature to lose all of their iWork documents stored in iCloud Drive. According to multiple posters on the <em>MacRumors</em> <a href=""http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1787223"">forums</a>, using the &quot;Reset All Settings&quot; option under General --&gt; Reset has caused documents to be permanently deleted from iCloud Drive.
<br>

<br>
<img class=""aligncenter  wp-image-424027"" src=""http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2014/09/resetallsettings.jpg"" alt=""resetallsettings"" width=""454""><blockquote>Because iOS 8 was so sluggish on my iPad 3 I reset all settings (No data or media will be deleted) and sped it up BUT deleted my iWork data! Then promptly synced and deleted it in iCloud.I have public beta of Yosemite so can&apos;t roll back via time machine. I have no pre iOS 8 backups in iTunes or iCloud to revert to (well iCloud device backups don&apos;t contain cloud documents and I should have iOS 7 backups in iTunes but can&apos;t find any. iCloud has no trash like dropbox. They seem gone forever.</blockquote>The &quot;Reset All Settings&quot; option explicitly says that &quot;No data or media will be deleted,&quot; and it is meant to reset all user preferences to the default out-of-the-box settings. That the option is deleting iCloud Drive documents appears to be a serious bug, though it may be limited to Apple&apos;s own iWork apps like <em>Pages</em>, <em>Keynote</em>, and <em>Numbers</em>. One <a href=""http://forums.macrumors.com/showpost.php?p=19884237&amp;postcount=8"">user</a> had all of his iWork documents wiped by using &quot;Reset All Settings,&quot; while other app information remained in iCloud.
<br>

<br>
In our own testing, using &quot;Reset All Settings&quot; deleted all iWork documents stored in iCloud Drive on the iPhone and on iCloud.com. After allowing time for syncing to a Mac running OS X Yosemite, all of the documents disappeared from that machine as well. Preview and TextEdit documents, which cannot be accessed on the iPhone, remained untouched on the Mac.
<br>

<br>
There appears to be no simple way to recover iCloud Drive documents that have been erased by &quot;Reset All Settings&quot; in Yosemite, and several people who have been affected by the bug are now in contact with Apple support in an effort to retrieve their documents. A <a href=""http://forums.macrumors.com/showpost.php?p=19880900&amp;postcount=1"">Mavericks user</a> was, however, able to recover his files from a backup folder, and OS X Yosemite users may also have luck with <a href=""http://forums.macrumors.com/showpost.php?p=19956866&amp;postcount=157"">recovering files via Time Machine</a>.
<br>

<br>
One user said that Apple was waiting on engineers to investigate the issue, while another said his account had been <a href=""http://forums.macrumors.com/showpost.php?p=19915227&amp;postcount=10"">placed</a> in troubleshooting mode to attempt to recover the data.
<br>

<br>
Introduced with iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite, <a href=""https://www.apple.com/ios/whats-new/icloud-drive/"">iCloud Drive</a> is Apple&apos;s answer to cloud-based storage services like Dropbox. iCloud Drive allows users to store a variety of documents like spreadsheets, PDFs, images, and more, accessing them on any device. Currently OS X Mavericks users can access iCloud Drive documents via iCloud.com, but iCloud Drive will be fully functional in October, after OS X Yosemite is released.
<br>

<br>
Users who have iCloud Drive enabled may want to refrain from using the &quot;Reset All Settings&quot; option on their devices for the time being, in order to avoid accidentally erasing important documents stored in iCloud Drive.</div>

  <p>If you&apos;re already using iOS 8&apos;s iCloud Drive feature, you might want to avoid your iPhone&apos;s &quot;Reset&quot; menu.&#xA0;<a href=""http://www.macrumors.com/2014/09/29/reset-all-settings-icloud-drive-bug/""><i>M</i><i>acRumors</i> reports</a> that a newly discovered bug causes iCloud Drive documents to be permanently erased from the cloud whenever a a user picks &quot;Reset All Settings.&quot; Ordinarily this option would simply do what it says; the iPhone&apos;s settings and preferences are immediately reset to their original factory defaults. No media (music, photos, etc.) or documents are supposed to be erased or otherwise affected when performing this action &#x2014; that should only happen if you choose &quot;Erase All Content and Settings&quot; and wipe your phone entirely.</p>


<p>But something&apos;s clearly not right, with <i>MacRumors</i> reporting that documents stored in iCloud Drive are disappearing from Apple&apos;s iWork apps upon reset. They&apos;re also vanishing from OS X Yosemite, which will bring iCloud Drive to Mac users later this fall. Right now, it&apos;s iOS users along with Yosemite developers and beta testers reporting the problem. iCloud Drive is also&#xA0;<a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/19/6508795/icloud-drive-for-pcs-before-macs"">available on Windows</a>, but it&apos;s unclear if the issue has popped up there. It&apos;s also not yet obvious how widespread the bug is or whether it affects everyone that has transitioned to iCloud Drive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In our own testing, using &quot;Reset All Settings&quot; deleted all iWork documents stored in iCloud Drive on the iPhone and on iCloud.com. After allowing time for syncing to a Mac running OS X Yosemite, all of the documents disappeared from that machine as well. Preview and TextEdit documents, which cannot be accessed on the iPhone, remained untouched on the Mac.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There&apos;s no easy way of recovering documents deleted from iCloud. Apple added a &quot;recently deleted&quot; folder to Photos in iOS 8, but hasn&apos;t yet implemented a similar option for all of iCloud. MacRumors notes the issue &quot;may be limited to Apple&apos;s own iWork apps like Pages, Keynote, and Numbers&quot; and iCloud Drive files from other third-party apps could be safe from the bug. But for now, the best option is avoiding &quot;Reset All Settings&quot; entirely until a fix is in place. We&apos;ve reached out to Apple for clarification on just what&apos;s going on.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Apple, things aren&apos;t looking much better this week, as <em>MacRumors</em> reports on a particularly nasty iOS 8 bug, which could potentially erase the iWork documents stored in your iCloud drive. </p> <p>According to the <a href=""http://www.macrumors.com/2014/09/29/reset-all-settings-icloud-drive-bug/"">report</a>, the option to &quot;Reset All Settings,&quot; found under Settings &#x2014; General &#x2014; Reset in iOS 8, also deletes documents from the iCloud Drive &#x2014; permanently. </p>
<p>The option, which normally resets settings to factory defaults, clearly states that &quot;no data or media will be deleted.&quot; However, after some users on <a href=""http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1787223""><em>MacRumors</em>&apos; forum</a> complained about the bug, MacRumors tested the option out, and indeed, all the iWork documents stored in iCloud Drive both on the iPhone and on iCloud.com were gone. </p>
<p>Even worse, after iCloud synced with a Mac running OS X Yosemite, the documents were deleted from the Mac as well. Some of the documents &#x2014; including Preview and TextEdit files &#x2014; were untouched, but all iWork files seem to be affected. </p>
<p>In some scenarios it&apos;s possible to retrieve these files from a backup folder, or via Time Machine, but nothing is certain at this point, and Apple still hasn&apos;t publicly acknowledged the bug. For now, iOS 8 users who have iCloud Drive enabled should probably avoid using the &quot;Reset All Settings&quot; option.</p> </section>",mashable.com,,1

It could delete files stored in the cloud.<br>

<p><span id=""ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-159"" class=""ezoic-adpicker-ad""></span><span id=""ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617"" class=""ezoic-adpicker-ad""></span>The bug was <a href=""http://www.macrumors.com/2014/09/29/reset-all-settings-icloud-drive-bug/"">discovered by MacRumors</a>, who found that selecting the &#x201C;Reset All Settings&#x201D; option from Settings in iOS 8 will erase iWork-related files in iCloud Drive. </p>
<p>This is not the way it&#x2019;s supposed to work. When you reset an iPhone or iPad&#x2019;s settings, iOS will even tell you that no data or media will be deleted. But in iOS 8, this isn&#x2019;t working as intended.</p>
<p>The good news is if you don&#x2019;t use iWork, you don&#x2019;t have anything to fear: The deleted files bug seems to be specific to iWork documents. But you should still probably stay clear of the &#x201C;Reset All Settings&#x201D; option until Apple gets this sorted out. Better safe than sorry.</p>

As discovered by <em>MacRumors</em>, the issue <a href=""http://www.macrumors.com/2014/09/29/reset-all-settings-icloud-drive-bug/"">presents itself</a> when iPhone and iPad users attempt to reset preferences via the device&apos;s Settings &gt; General &gt; Reset &gt; Reset All Settings option. The feature allows users to troubleshoot possible iOS issues by reverting all system settings back to factory baselines.</p>
As OS X 10.10 Yosemite, and subsequently iCloud Drive, is not yet available for consumer download aside from Apple&apos;s public beta testing program, the effects on consumers are non-existent. However, with a large number of untrained public beta participants opting in to the service with iOS 8, the problem could become serious. According to the report, one iPad user performed the reset and found his local iWork documents deleted, which consequently wiped those same documents from the cloud when the tablet synced to iCloud. It appears only data from first-party apps connected to iCloud Drive are affected by the bug, though not all users are seeing the issue play out as described. In some cases, files are being delete upon syncing with iCloud, while other data remains untouched. It is suggested that users back up iCloud Drive documents to a local computer prior to performing the Reset All Settings operation.
iCloud Drive is Apple&apos;s solution to cloud storage, syncing and collaboration. The system allows seamless file transport and storage across iOS, OS X and Windows, while enabling advanced features like document editing, asset tagging and drag-and-drop data management.<p>
Apple will activate iCloud Drive alongside the release of OS X Yosemite later this fall, bringing the company&apos;s The feature has already rolled out to beta testers, as well as the iCloud.com <a href=""http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/09/10/apple-adds-icloud-drive-and-settings-to-icloudcom-beta-webpage"">beta website</a>, which now supports access and editing of stored documents. </p><br></div> </div> </div>",,,325

Last week, security research Stefan Esser noted that QuickType was offering up his unique passwords as autocorrect suggestions, and now <a href=""http://www.macrumors.com/2014/09/29/reset-all-settings-icloud-drive-bug/""><em>MacRumors</em> forum users are reporting</a> that the &#x2018;Reset All Settings&#x2019; feature on <a href=""http://bgr.com/tag/ios-8"">iOS 8</a> is deleting iWork documents from the newly-implemented <a href=""http://bgr.com/tag/icloud-drive"">iCloud Drive</a> service.<span id=""more-3853870""></span></p>

<p>One third-generation iPad user was less than satisfied with the performance of their tablet after updating to iOS 8. In order to fix the problem, they decided to reset all the settings on their iPad, which, according to the text box, should&#xA0;restore the default settings but leave data and media&#xA0;intact. Instead, all of the iWork data disappeared on both the tablet and within iCloud Drive.</p> <p><em>MacRumors</em> attempted to recreate the scenario and recorded the same results: files from Apple&#x2019;s iWork apps, such as Numbers, Page and Keynote, vanished shortly after the settings had been reset. Other files, such as Preview and TextEdit documents, were still accessible.</p>
<p>If you were considering activating iCloud Drive, it might be worth waiting until Apple has time to address this issue.

Apple&apos;s new mobile operating system has been riddled with problems since Day One, and the latest issue may be one of its most insidious. Users have discovered that by resetting an iOS 8 device&apos;s user preferences to the defaults, their iCloud files may disappear as well.</p> <p>Disgruntled iOS 8 users have gathered at the <a href=""http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1787223"">MacRumors</a> forums to swap war stories, and the issue seems fairly widespread. iPad 3 owner Chris Newbold complained of slow load times on iOS 8, but when he chose &quot;Reset All Settings&quot; (not a factory reset, which wipes all user data from a device) to address the issue, he found that all of his iWork data had disappeared, even though iOS 8 assured him at the beginning of the process that it would not delete any data or media.</p> <p><strong>MORE: <a href=""https://www.tomsguide.com/us/iphone-6-ios-8-problems,news-19611.html"">All the iPhone 6 (and iOS 8) Fails to Date</a></strong></p> <p>Newbold was hardly alone: As the thread continued, other users reported the same phenomenon, and had varying degrees of success recovering their files. Some were able to use Apple&apos;s Time Machine software to roll back the clock and restore their cloud files, but others found that the bug wiped out even the backups.</p> <p><a href=""http://www.macrumors.com/2014/09/29/reset-all-settings-icloud-drive-bug/"">MacRumors tested</a> the phenomenon itself and was able to confirm Newbold&apos;s findings. Reset All Settings does indeed wipe out users&apos; cloud files, and as soon as the phone syncs with their computers, recovering them via Time Machine is difficult, too.</p> <p>For the time being, Apple has not officially addressed the issue, so don&apos;t reset your iOS 8 device unless you have all your files backed up somewhere other than iCloud. If you&apos;ve already undergone the process and lost your files, some users have had good luck after contacting Apple Support.

http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/22/apple-plans-to-shut-down-beats-music/,Apple Plans To Shut Down Beats Music,Josh Constine,2014-09-22T00:00:00.000Z,"<div><div class=""article-entry text""> <img src=""https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/beatsmusic-shutterstock_132921989-1.jpg?w=738"" class="""">
<p id=""speakable-summary"">Apple will discontinue the streaming music service Beats Music it acquired in May, according to five sources, including several prominent employees at Apple and Beats. Many engineers from Beats Music have already been moved off the product and onto other projects at Apple, including iTunes. It&#x2019;s not clear when exactly Jimmy Iovine and Dr Dre&#x2019;s music service will be shut down or what Apple will do with streaming, but every source with knowledge of the situation that we talked to agreed Apple plans to sunset the Beats Music brand.</p>
<p>[<strong>Update</strong>: Apple has told TechCrunch&#xA0;that our report of Beats being shut down &#x201C;is not true&#x201D;,&#xA0;but sources familiar with the situation tell <a href=""http://recode.net/2014/09/22/apples-beats-music-brand-may-go-away-apples-beats-music-service-is-sticking-around/"">Re/code</a> that Apple &#x201C;may, however, modify [Beats Music] over time, and one of those changes could involved changing the Beats Music&#xA0;brand.&#x201D; This aligns with what my sources said, which is that the Beats Music brand will be shut down, but that it&#x2019;s unclear what Apple wants to do in streaming music. It seems quite possible that the Beats Music product could be rolled into iTunes rather than being &#x2018;shuttered&#x2019;, but that&#x2019;s semantics.</p>
<p>Apple&#x2019;s response&#xA0;really depends on the interpretation of &#x201C;shut down&#x201D;. If Apple rolls Beats Music into iTunes and removes the dedicated Beats Music app from the App Store, I would call that being shut down. Beats Music itself came from a &#x201C;rebranding&#x201D; aka shutdown of the MOG music streaming service it acquired. We&#x2019;ll see what happens if and when Apple adds streaming to iTunes, but its doubtful that Apple will maintain Beats Music as its own brand and independent product.]</p>
<p>The fact that the new iPhones did not come pre-installed with Beats Music, while several other Apple apps <a href=""http://www.imore.com/yes-iwork-apps-are-pre-installed-64gb-and-128gb-iphone-6-and-iphone-6-plus"">came loaded</a> on the 6 and 6 Plus, should have been a red flag. There was also nothing said about Beats Music during the Apple Watch reveal, even though the service&#x2019;s radio and fire-and-forget playlists could work well on a wearable. In August, Beats Music was <a href=""http://9to5mac.com/2014/08/12/apple-prominently-advertising-beats-music-to-new-ios-device-users/"">being advertised to new users</a> on iOS 7, yet the only time Beats Music got an off-hand mention at the September launch event was when Apple CEO Tim Cook said the new U2 album would be available there.</p>
<p>Instead of Beats Music, the Apple Watch features a <del>unannounced music app</del> [Update: Remote app] with a blue play button (top right in the photo below) that instantly started playing songs when tapped during a demo.</p>

<p>Considering Apple&#x2019;s penchant for simple, unified brands, and how it despises fragmentation, shutting down Beats Music makes a lot of sense. Running a second music service in parallel with iTunes that forces people to learn a whole new interface might have confused customers. Beats Music&#x2019;s CEO <a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/08/01/with-apple-beats-deal-complete-ian-rogers-to-run-itunes-radio/"">Ian Rogers was also put in charge of iTunes Radio</a>, meaning he&#x2019;s already splitting his time rather than just focusing on Beats Music.</p>
<p>Shutting down Beats Music also meshes with reports that the Beats acquisition was <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-05-29/apple-beats-deal-headphones-cool-factor-talent"">mostly about</a> getting Jimmy Iovine and <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/22/apples-beats-deal-is-happening-and-its-a-dre-acquihire/"">Dr. Dre&#x2019;s</a> talent on board, and picking up the headphone business, not about streaming music. Having Beats as a side brand in music accessories flows naturally, but seems clumsy when it comes to software. We&#x2019;ve contacted Apple with a request for comment on its plans for Beat Music. [Update: Response in update above.]</p>

<p>Beats Music&#x2019;s growth has likely been hampered by its late start compared to competitors like Spotify, Rdio, Google Music, and Pandora. Though its strategy was to differentiate itself through curated playlists and mood-based radio, those failed to capture the attention of mainstream listeners. Thanks to seven-day free trials and multi-month demos through AT&amp;T, 5&#xA0;million people had tried Beats by May, but only 250,000 had signed up for a paid subscription. That&#x2019;s pretty small compared to the 10 million paid subscribers and 40 million total listeners on Spotify, and&#xA0;<a href=""http://investor.pandora.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=227956&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1951104&amp;highlight="">76.4 million</a>&#xA0;active listeners on Pandora. Yet stacked up against the iTunes userbase, Beats Music is just a drop in the bucket for Apple. Apple certainly didn&#x2019;t hesitate to shut down music streaming service Lala after acquiring it.</p>
<p>The big question is what will Apple do with streaming music. Buying Beats Music may still assist Apple hear through talent, technology, and industry relationships even without the Beats Music brand.</p>
<p>One source said Apple may roll streaming into iTunes. This could be the most logical strategy for&#xA0;Apple if it can find a way to keep its traditional music file download customers happy while opening its catalogue to streaming for early adopters who want to listen from the cloud. Perhaps rather than just buy buttons, there could be play buttons in iTunes, too. Another source said Apple plans to make some significant music announcement in the first half of next year.</p>

<p>Apple is in the tricky position of trying to <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/28/a-smooth-transition-from-music-sales-to-streaming/"">smoothly transition its music business</a> from the download to the streaming era. Digital music sales fell 13.3 percent in 2013, while U.S. streaming grew 32 percent. With <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/03/streaming-is-killing-downloads/"">streaming eating downloads</a>, Apple will have to make a shift or at least accomodate streaming. But it doesn&#x2019;t just want to ditch sales overnight. 1.26 billion songs and 117.6 million albums were sold online in 2013, providing <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/22/bridging-the-download-and-cloud-music-eras/"">vital capital to the music industry</a>.</p>
<p>Forcing users across the chasm from iTunes to Beats Music seems precarious, especially with on-demand streaming competitors like Spotify and Google Music looking to pounce on potential customers. It&#x2019;s doubtful that Apple would abandon its iTunes brand after 13 years of success just because Beats joined the family. Evolving a unified Apple music service sounds a lot better than having two playing out of sync.</p>

          <div class=""content""><img class=""alignright size-full wp-image-410810"" src=""http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2014/05/beats.png"" alt=""beats"" width=""175"">Apple is planning to discontinue Beats Music, the streaming music service that it acquired as part of an acquisition of Beats Electronics back in May. According to <em><a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/22/apple-plans-to-shut-down-beats-music"">TechCrunch</a></em>, multiple sources that include &quot;several prominent employees at Apple and Beats&quot; have confirmed that Apple is shutting down the music service.<blockquote>Many engineers from Beats Music have already been moved off the product and onto other projects at Apple, including iTunes. It&apos;s not clear when exactly Jimmy Iovine and Dr Dre&apos;s music service will be shut down or what Apple will do with streaming, but every source with knowledge of the situation that we talked to agreed Apple plans to sunset the Beats Music brand.</blockquote>Apple first acquired Beats Music in May, and at the time, announced plans to leave the music service untouched. There were no plans to integrate Beats Music into iTunes, with the company suggesting that it would remain as a standalone service.
<br>

<br>
<em>TechCrunch</em> suggests that the fact that Beats Music did not come pre-loaded onto the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus serves as a &quot;red flag&quot; that the music service is on its way out. The site also pointed towards an Apple Watch demo that included an &quot;unannounced music app with a blue play button that instantly started playing songs when tapped during a demo,&quot; but that icon appears to correspond to the <a href=""http://appshopper.com/entertainment/remote"">Remote app</a> and not a new music app.
<br>

<br>
Apple shutting down Beats Music is unusual news given the efforts that the company has gone to in order to promote it in recent weeks, adding it to the list of &quot;<a href=""http://www.macrumors.com/2014/08/15/beats-music-apps-by-apple/"">Apps Made by Apple</a>&quot; and recommending the app to new iOS users. If Apple plans to do away with Beats Music, it is unclear what further moves it will make in the streaming music arena. Beats Music was seen as the company&apos;s answer to popular services like Spotify, aimed at bolstering flagging music sales.
<br>

<br>
According to one source who spoke to <em>TechCrunch</em>, Apple might be planning to roll streaming music into iTunes, creating a unified Apple music service after shutting down Beats Music.
<br>

<br>
<b>Update:</b> According to an Apple representative that spoke to <a href=""http://recode.net/2014/09/22/apples-beats-music-brand-may-go-away-apples-beats-music-service-is-sticking-around/""><em>Re/code</em></a>, the company is not planning to shut down Beats Music.<blockquote>So why would Apple plan to shut down Beats Music, as a TechCrunch headline reports?
<br>
Answer: It&apos;s not.
<br>

<br>
Tom Neumayr, says the TechCrunch story is &quot;not true&quot;, but wouldn&#x2019;t elaborate.</blockquote>While the spokesperson declined to elaborate, <em>Re/code</em> suggests that while Apple does not plan to shut down Beats Music, it may &quot;modify it over time,&quot; changing the brand name.<br><br></div>

</p> <p> Apple spokesman&#xA0;Tom Neumayr said rumors of Beats Music&apos;s shuttering were &quot;not true&quot; <a href=""http://recode.net/2014/09/22/apples-beats-music-brand-may-go-away-apples-beats-music-service-is-sticking-around/""> in a statement to Re/code&apos;s Peter Kafka</a>. However, Kafka adds that Beats Music may be rebranded in the future.
</p> <p> Beats Music is similar to Spotify, Rdio, and other streaming music services. You pay $10 a month for unlimited access to songs from all the major record labels. The service was one of the key reasons Apple bought Beats Electronics for $3 billion earlier this year. Beats also makes popular headphones and other audio accessories.
</p> <p> It&apos;s more likely that Apple will take the Beats Music technology and incorporate it into iTunes or iTunes Radio. Shutting it down wouldn&apos;t make any sense, especially considering Apple CEO Tim Cook <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-on-why-apple-bought-beats-2014-9""> recently told Charlie Rose</a> that he was so impressed with Beats Music that he &quot;couldn&apos;t sleep&quot; after listening to it for the first time. That doesn&apos;t sound like a product Cook would want to kill off.
</p> <p> Beats Music also has a neat feature that Apple might want to incorporate into future products. &quot;The sentence&quot; gives users the opportunity to select music based on their activity or location (think &quot;I&apos;m on a boat&quot; or &quot;I&apos;m on a rooftop and feel like going back in time&quot;).

The blog&apos;s Josh Constine says that he&apos;s confirmed the news with five sources at both Apple and Beats. And to be honest, it makes sense. </p><p>(<em>Update:</em> Apple <a href=""http://recode.net/2014/09/22/apples-beats-music-brand-may-go-away-apples-beats-music-service-is-sticking-around/"">told Re/Code</a> that the TechCrunch story is &quot;not true&quot; but did not deny that the company could fold Beats Music into iTunes.)</p><p>It seems very unlikely that Apple is going to abandon streaming music altogether. If true, news that Beats Music is dying reads as a clear indication that Apple is going to create its own streaming service or simply expand iTunes Radio. Constine <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/22/apple-plans-to-shut-down-beats-music/"">agrees</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Considering Apple&apos;s penchant for simple, unified brands, and how it despises fragmentation, shutting down Beats Music makes a lot of sense. Running a second music service in parallel with iTunes that forces people to learn a whole new interface might have confused customers. Beats Music&apos;s CEO <a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/08/01/with-apple-beats-deal-complete-ian-rogers-to-run-itunes-radio/"">Ian Rogers was also put in charge of iTunes Radio</a>, meaning he&apos;s already splitting his time rather than just focusing on Beats Music.</p></blockquote><p>Based on images of the home screen, Constine adds, it looks like Apple&apos;s readying a new music app just for the new Apple Watch. People thought the company&apos;s music app for wearables would be Beats Music. And maybe it sort of is on the back end! It just won&apos;t be called Beats Music. </p><p>After the news broke, Apple&apos;s Tom Neumayr told Re/Code&apos;s Peter Kafka that the TechCrunch story was &quot;not true.&quot; Kafka, however, elaborates that Apple &quot;may, however, modify it over time, and one of those changes could involved changing the Beats Music brand.&quot; That does not rule out the idea that Beats Music could be rolled into iTunes, which is what many analysts have thought would happen since the acquisition. Regardless, it seems like something is up. We&apos;ll have to wait and see exactly what that something is.

  <p>Beats Music will eventually disappear as a brand,&#xA0;<a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/22/apple-plans-to-shut-down-beats-music/"">according to a new report</a>. <i>TechCrunch</i> reports that Apple plans to eliminate the Beats Music streaming service, which&#xA0;<a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2014/5/28/5700530/apple-confirms-beats-acquisition"">it acquired in May</a>, but doesn&apos;t say when. The report is less clear on what Apple plans to do with streaming music. One source tells TechCrunch that on-demand music could be integrated into iTunes; another source says Apple will make a &quot;significant music announcement&quot; in the first half of 2015.</p>


 

<p>Engineers from Beats Music have already been transferred to other divisions at Apple, including iTunes, according to the report. As <i>TechCrunch</i> notes, Beats Music CEO Ian Rogers was&#xA0;<a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/08/01/with-apple-beats-deal-complete-ian-rogers-to-run-itunes-radio/"">put in charge of Apple&apos;s ad-supported iTunes Radio</a> product in August and has been splitting his time between the services since then.</p>
<p><q class=""center"">&quot;The first music subscription service done right&quot;</q></p>
<p>When Apple bought the Beats brand for $3 billion, Apple senior vice president Eddy Cue called Beats Music &quot;<a href=""http://live.theverge.com/apple-beats-eddy-cue-jimmy-iovine-codecon/"">the first music subscription service done right</a>.&quot; Though it mostly mimicked existing services from Spotify, Rdio, and others, Beats Music tried to differentiate itself through hand-curated playlists and the involvement of music-industry titans like Dr. Dre and Trent Reznor. But after three months it had only 250,000 subscribers, compared to&#xA0;<a href=""https://press.spotify.com/us/information/"">over 10 million</a> on Spotify. Still, Cue had positioned Beats as a key component of Apple&apos;s music strategy, saying that the company wanted to offer on-demand listening along with ad-supported radio and digital downloads.</p>
<p>All of which suggests that while the Beats Music brand may be going away, on-demand streaming from Apple could easily take another form. If iTunes is remade as a kind of celestial jukebox that combines your MP3s and on-demand streaming into a single place, the Beats Music brand going away might not be such a bad thing, after all.</p>


<p>Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>


<p><b>Update, 4:43 p.m.</b>: An Apple spokesman tells <i>Recode</i> that TechCrunch&apos;s report is &quot;<a href=""http://recode.net/2014/09/22/apples-beats-music-brand-may-go-away-apples-beats-music-service-is-sticking-around/"">not true</a>,&quot; though he won&apos;t elaborate. <i>Recode</i> says Apple plans to continue to offer on-demand streaming but may &quot;modify&quot; the Beats Music brand over time, suggesting it may fold the service into iTunes.</p>

Apple's Beats Music Service Is Sticking Around.,,2014-09-22T18:41:28.000Z,"<div><div class=""c-entry-content c-entry-content__legacy""> <p>Earlier this year, <a href=""http://recode.net/2014/05/28/apple-buys-beats-for-3-billion/"">Apple bought Beats Music and Beats Electronics for $3 billion</a>. Since then, CEO <a href=""http://recode.net/2014/05/28/tim-cook-explains-why-apple-is-buying-beats-qa/"">Tim Cook has gone out of his way to rave about the Beats Music subscription service</a>, which sells all-you-can-eat music for $10 a month.</p> <p>So why would Apple plan to shut down Beats Music, as a TechCrunch headline <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/22/apple-plans-to-shut-down-beats-music/"">reports</a>?</p>
<p>Answer: It&#x2019;s not.</p>
<p>Tom Neumayr, Apple&#x2019;s PR rep, says the TechCrunch story is &#x201C;not true&#x201D; but wouldn&#x2019;t go beyond that.</p>
<p>I can elaborate a bit more, based on conversations with people familiar with Apple&#x2019;s thinking: Apple won&#x2019;t shutter the streaming service. It may, however, modify it over time, and one of those changes could involved changing the Beats Music&#xA0;brand.</p> <p>Note that Apple does seem pretty pleased with the iTunes brand, which was the focus of its <a href=""http://recode.net/2014/09/11/the-internet-wants-to-know-where-to-return-apples-gift/"">controversial U2 album giveaway</a> this month.</p>
<p>Shuttering the Beats Music brand name makes some sense, as the company hadn&#x2019;t generated a ton of traction before Apple bought it in May &#x2014; at that time, it only had a few hundred thousand subscribers. On the other hand, the Beats headphone brand, which Apple doesn&#x2019;t have any plans to dump, does have a lot of recognition, so it would seem bizarre to dump that.</p>

As noted by <em>MacRumors</em>, AT&amp;T has <a href=""http://www.macrumors.com/2014/10/15/att-stops-offering-beats-subscriptions/"">abruptly stopped</a> selling Beats Music subscriptions to its customers and is has taken down access to a free trial period previously open to all comers. The option to subscribe via AT&amp;T has also been removed from Beats Music&apos;s own webpage. </p><p>
An AT&amp;T spokesperson offered further clarification to <em>AppleInsider</em>, saying only that the policy shift does not affect those customers currently enrolled in a Beats Music family plan or the service&apos;s trial period. </p>
&quot;There haven&apos;t been any changes for AT&amp;T customers who currently have the Beats Music family plan or who are within their free trial period,&quot; the spokesperson said. &quot;New subscribers can still get Beats Music through their app store or at beatsmusic.com.&quot; <p>
Before Beats Music debuted <a href=""http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/01/21/beats-music-subscription-internet-radio-service-launches-with-ios-app"">in January</a>, the company inked an exclusive deal with AT&amp;T to sell subscriptions as part of bundled cellular plans. Under certain contract terms, like the above mentioned family plan, customers were able to bill Beats Music to their wireless bill and share the service with up to five family members.</p><p>
No information was provided as to the change in availability, though Apple is rumored to be working on new options for the streaming music service. The company <a href=""http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/09/22/apple-reportedly-planning-to-shut-down-beats-music-subscription-streaming-service"">denied reports</a> from September saying Beats Music would be shuttered and rolled into iTunes Radio, but left open the possibility of rebranding.</p></div> </div> </div>",,,274

The publication cites sources at Apple as saying branding for Beats Music could change in the future, though the streaming service itself will remain active. The article has been updated to reflect the new information.</p><p>
Citing five sources at Apple and Beats, <em>TechCrunch</em> reported <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/22/apple-plans-to-shut-down-beats-music/"">on Monday</a> that although the exact timetable is unknown, Apple plans to sunset the Beats Music service and brand. People involved in the product are said to have already been moved onto other projects at the company, including iTunes.</p><p>
If true, the move would be a change from May, when Apple <a href=""http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/05/28/apple-emphasizes-acquisition-of-beats-music-service-in-blockbuster-announcement"">emphasized Beats Music</a> as a key component of its $3 billion purchase of the headphone maker. The Beats Music product received top billing over Beats Electronics in Apple&apos;s press release announcing the deal, even though the headphone making side of the business is the brand&apos;s most recognizable role.</p><p>
Observers also believed that the Beats Music service allowed Apple to enter a <a href=""http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/05/29/wall-street-warming-up-to-3b-apple-beats-deal-sees-potential-to-offset-declining-itunes-revenue"">key subscription market</a> where the iTunes Store and iTunes Radio do not compete. Sales of digital albums have been declining in recent years as customers have migrated to competing services like Spotify and Pandora.</p><p>
But Beats Music also got off to a <a href=""http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/05/13/beats-music-had-110k-subscribers-in-march-with-impressive-free-to-paid-conversion"">slow start</a>, with just 110,000 subscribers as of March. Its performance since being acquired by Apple remains unknown.</p><div><div class=""article-img""><img src=""http://photos2.insidercdn.com/v9/images/1x1-white.jpg"" alt="""" class=""lazy lazy""></div><br><span class=""minor2 small gray"">Source: <a href=""http://www.beatsmusic.com/"">Beats Music</a></span></div><p>
The rumor would suggest that Apple&apos;s $3 billion buyout of Beats was really about the headphones side of the business, as well as the <a href=""http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/05/22/apple-wants-beats-for-jimmy-iovine-and-dr-dre-not-technology"">talent and credibility</a> brought on by the &quot;acqui-hires&quot; of Beats&apos;s Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre.</p>
Iovine is a longtime music industry executive and was a personal friend of late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. Both he and Dr. Dre have considerable sway in the industry and could help secure content for Apple&apos;s iTunes business.<p>
When it was announced earlier this year, Apple&apos;s $3 billion buyout of Beats proved controversial, with critics suggesting that the iPhone maker had overpaid for a company better known for its brand than quality products. But proponents believe the addition of Beats products to Apple&apos;s portfolio will help the company earn revenue from a lucrative accessories market where the company did not previously compete.</p></div>",,,425

<p>According to <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/22/apple-plans-to-shut-down-beats-music/"">a report published by TechCrunch</a>, <a href=""http://variety.com/t/apple/"" id=""auto-tag_apple"">Apple</a> has begun to wind down the streaming music service that it acquired in May, with many of its staffers already moved onto other projects at Apple. <a href=""http://variety.com/t/itunes/"" id=""auto-tag_itunes"">ITunes</a> is said to be one of them.</p>
<p>Beats Music CEO Ian Rogers already has been put in charge of iTunes Radio, with the Beats Music technology likely to be integrated into that service, sources say.</p>
<p>Beats Music has not been heavily promoted during Apple&#x2019;s recent product demonstrations, including the launch of its new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, as well as its Apple Watch.</p>
<p>In fact, the new smartphones do not include Beats Music pre-loaded as an app &#x2014; an unusual move and sign that Apple has other plans for Beats Music&#x2019; technology. U2&#x2019;s free album was offered through Beats Music.</p> <p>While the Apple Watch, out next year, will include a music app, Beats Music wasn&#x2019;t mentioned during its launch demo.</p>
<p>The confusion two separate music services could generate among consumers is said to be one of the reasons Apple is making the move to close Beats Music. Apple also had shut down another streaming service, Lala, after acquiring it.</p>
<p>While Apple isn&#x2019;t expected to entirely do away with Beats Music, the company is rethinking whether to still operate it as a separate brand, sources <a href=""http://recode.net/2014/09/22/apples-beats-music-brand-may-go-away-apples-beats-music-service-is-sticking-around/"">also confirmed to Re/Code</a>.</p>
<p>While Beats Music has the Beats headphone brand helping put it in the spotlight, the service has struggled to compete against more established online players like Spotify, Pandora, Rdio and Google Music.</p>
<p>It had just 111,000 paying subscribers in March, and 250,000 in May, according to Jimmy Iovine. That&#x2019;s compared to 10 million for Spotify.</p>
<p>Beats Music was part of the $3 billion purchase of Beats Electronics Apple made in August.</p>

<p>Apple said it had no official plans to &#x201C;shutter&#x201D; the service, but did not provide more details on how it might be used in the future.</p>
<p>Apple is having to take a close look at its iTunes business as digital music sales fell 13.3% in 2013, whereas streaming grew 32% last year in the U.S.</p> </div>",variety.com,,369

<p><a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-shutting-down-beats-music-2014-9"">Business Insider</a> predicts that the Beats Music streaming service will be absorbed into the larger iTunes ecosystem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s more likely that Apple will take the Beats Music technology and incorporate it into iTunes and/or iTunes Radio. Apple CEO Tim Cook recently told Charlie Rose that he was so impressed with Beats Music that he &#x201C;couldn&#x2019;t sleep&#x201D; after listening to it for the first time. That doesn&#x2019;t sound like a product Cook would want to completely kill off.</p>
<p>Beats Music also has a neat feature that Apple might want to incorporate into future products. &#x201C;The sentence&#x201D; gives users the opportunity to select music based on their activity or location (think &#x201C;I&#x2019;m on a boat&#x201D; or &#x201C;I&#x2019;m on a rooftop and feel like going back in time&#x201D;).&#x201D;</p>

It does seem odd that Apple would add Beats to the Apple TV one week, and then start shutting down the service a week later. It&#x2019;s fair to assume that if the rumors are true, and Apple is killing Beats Music, it won&#x2019;t shut down the service overnight.<br>

http://www.macrumors.com/2014/10/15/att-stops-offering-beats-subscriptions/,AT&T No Longer Offering Beats Music Subscriptions to Customers,Juli Clover,2014-10-15T20:18:00.000Z,"<div><div class=""article"">
          
          
          <div class=""content"">AT&amp;T is no longer offering Beats Music subscriptions to its subscribers as an add-on service, according to an AT&amp;T employee who spoke to <em>MacRumors.</em> The cellular company has ceased giving customers the option to sign up for Beats Music when purchasing a new phone plan and the <a href=""http://www.beatsmusic.com/pricing"">Beats Music website</a> has been updated to remove its &quot;Subscribe with AT&amp;T&quot; options.
<br>

<br>
AT&amp;T employees have also been instructed to stop selling Beats Music subscriptions to customers, suggesting the partnership between Beats Music and AT&amp;T has come to an end following Apple&apos;s Beats acquisition.
<br>

<br>
<img src=""http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2014/10/attsubscribe.jpg"" alt=""attsubscribe"" width=""500"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-425613""><center><em>AT&amp;T subscription options <a href=""http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:pddZVd0mdsYJ:www.beatsmusic.com/pricing+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us"">formerly offered</a> on the Beats Music Pricing page</em></center>
<br>
Beats Music and AT&amp;T first struck an <a href=""http://www.fiercewireless.com/story/att-partners-beats-streaming-music-service/2014-01-13"">exclusive deal</a> shortly before the service&apos;s initial debut, with AT&amp;T offering multiple Beats Music subscription options, including a family pack that allowed users to share Beats Music with up to five family members. AT&amp;T also offered extended trial periods of up to 90 days and promoted the music service to customers both online and in-store.
<br>

<br>
It&apos;s likely the deal between Beats Music and AT&amp;T has ended due to Apple&apos;s <a href=""http://www.macrumors.com/2014/05/28/apple-buys-beats/"">$3 billion purchase</a> of both Beats Music and Beats Electronics in May, but it is unclear why AT&amp;T has been able to continue to offer Beats Music subscriptions up until October.
<br>

<br>
Rumors have suggested that Apple has plans to <a href=""http://www.macrumors.com/2014/09/22/apple-shutting-down-beats-music/"">rebrand Beats Music</a>, and its upcoming retooling may also be the reason behind the dissolution of the AT&amp;T partnership. Along with changing the Beats Music name, Apple is said to be planning to introduce new features and it is also hoping to offer the service at a lower cost, asking music labels <a href=""http://www.macrumors.com/2014/10/02/apple-labels-streaming-cut/"">to cut their rates</a>.
<br>

<br>
It is unknown when Apple plans to reveal its revamped music service, but rumors have hinted that its debut could come <a href=""http://www.macrumors.com/2014/09/23/apple-february-revamp-beats-music/"">alongside the 2015 Grammy Awards</a> in February, which means that Apple engineers and designers are likely already hard at work on the rebranding.
<br>

<br>
<b>Update</b>: Reached for comment, an AT&amp;T spokesman gave the following statement:<blockquote>There haven&#x2019;t been any changes for AT&amp;T customers who currently have the Beats Music family plan or who are within their free trial period. New subscribers can still get Beats Music through their app store or at beatsmusic.com.</blockquote></div>

http://pando.com/2014/09/09/source-apple-set-to-acquire-path-in-an-attempt-to-bolster-ios-social-cred/,Source: Apple set to acquire Path in an attempt to bolster iOS social cred,"Michael Carney , written on September 9, 2014",2014-09-10T03:20:00.000Z,"<div class=""contains-copy full""> <p>In a day packed with major Apple announcements, the company tackled smartphones, <a href=""http://pando.com/2014/09/09/the-apple-watch-could-be-worth-all-of-the-hyperbole-and-still-fail-terribly/"">wearables</a>, and <a href=""http://pando.com/2014/09/09/heres-why-applepay-will-majorly-shake-up-consumer-payments-landscape-even-if-it-gets-lost-amid-the-iphone-and-applewatch-frenzy/"">payments</a>. But there is one more sector that may be about to get the Apple treatment: Social.</p>
<p>According to a single well-placed source inside Apple&#x2019;s engineering team, the company is poised to announce an acquisition of Dave Morin&#x2019;s Path social network. To quote our source, who requested to remain anonymous because the deal has not been announced yet, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s almost done, if not signed already, but it&#x2019;s essentially a done deal.&#x201D;</p>
<p>If true, it would be major news for the heretofore <a href=""http://pando.com/2014/05/22/paths-kiss-of-death-compliment-its-hugely-popular-in-indonesia/"">struggling social platform</a> that has been known more for its design and user interface innovations than for its ability to drive adoption among consumers &#x2013; particularly in non-Asian markets. Apple hasn&#x2019;t fared much better in the social realm historically, having flopped with its Ping social network and having made very little out of its acquisition of the team and IP from failed location-based photo social network, Color.</p>
<p>According to our source, this is more than just a talent acquisition, or acquihire. The Path product will likely survive the acquisition and be incorporated, in whole or in part, into Apple&#x2019;s newly refreshed Messages app. That doesn&#x2019;t mean that the deal will be priced like some other recent high-profile mobile communication deals, namely Facebook&#x2019;s $19 billion Whatsapp acquisition and rumored $3 billion-plus offers extended to Snapchat by Facebook and Google.</p>
<p>Facebook paid $42 per Whatsapp user, and $33 per Instagram user before that. By comparison, Rakuten bought the far less beloved Viber for just $3 per user. With Path having somewhere in the vicinity of 25 million users at the beginning of this year, and far weaker growth and engagement than any of the above platforms, it would be lucky to command&#xA0;anywhere near Instagram/Whatsapp sums. According to App Annie, <a href=""http://www.appannie.com/apps/ios/app/403639508/app-ranking/#device=iphone&amp;daily=2014-09-08&amp;type=ranks"">Path ranks just 177th</a> among iOS Social Networking apps in the US and not among the top 1000 overall iOS apps. When Path raised its most recent round in January of this year, the company reportedly commanded a sub-$400 million valuation, well below the $500 million-plus levels reportedly sought by management. Given the trajectory it was on, exiting at that level would likely be considered a win among most Path insiders. Hell, for many Valley observers, that would be the win of the century for Path investors, many of which have all but left the company for dead.</p>
<p>Apple&#x2019;s re-entry into social would also be a notable development. With Facebook (including Instagram and Whatsapp), Twitter, and Snapchat each looking stronger than ever in their respective social verticals, it&#x2019;s unclear just where an Apple-driven social product would fit in among consumers daily habits. Google seems to have reached a similar conclusion, all but abandoning its strategy of pushing Google+ as a standalone social platform, and instead choosing to let the platform fade into the background of its other consumers platforms like Gmail and YouTube. Apple&#x2019;s one stronghold has been in messaging via iMessage, which recently got a facelift. And Path has recently leaned more in this direction with its launch of an ephemeral messaging product, abandoning its long-held <a href=""http://pando.com/2014/06/12/paths-dave-morin-gives-up-on-lasting-memories/"">love&#xA0;of&#xA0;more lasting, intimate communications</a>. It&#x2019;s certainly conceivable that Path could be integrated into Apple&apos;s messaging&#xA0;platform, but it&#x2019;s unclear, beyond the design prowess, how this acquisition helps Apple, at any price.</p>
<p>Adding additional fuel to this fire, Dave Morin was spotted sitting in the front row for today&#x2019;s Apple keynote event, a high profile position reserved for Dr. Dre and other key Apple insiders.
<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"">Did not forget about Dre. <a href=""http://t.co/fWNDpFhfYr"">pic.twitter.com/fWNDpFhfYr</a></blockquote></p>
<p>&#x2014; Dave Morin (@davemorin) <a href=""https://twitter.com/davemorin/status/509388253099601921"">September 9, 2014</a>
Apple has been known to be a fan of Morin&#x2019;s, as well as the Path design aesthetic and broader design team. Take for example the company&#x2019;s decision to feature the Path app early on in numerous keynotes and advertising campaigns. In that sense, it wouldn&#x2019;t be that surprising if such a deal were to be consummated. <a href=""http://blog.launch.co/blog/apple-knocks-it-out-of-the-park-will-be-first-trillion-dolla.html"">Jason Calacanis</a> made a similar observation in his evening email newsletter today, noting Morin&#x2019;s seating at today&#x2019;s event and Apple&#x2019;s long-standing frustrations around social. Others have been asking <a href=""http://www.quora.com/Should-Apple-acquire-Path"">whether such an acquisition makes sense</a> for years.</p>
<p>To be clear, even if our source is correct, these transactions&#xA0;are never a sure thing until ink has been put to paper and (at least in the case of a public company like Apple) a public announcement has been made. But the tea leaves seem to be aligning on this deal. It&apos;s certainly an unexpected outcome, but it would sound even more crazy if Apple didn&#x2019;t have north of $150 billion in cash burning a hole in its pocket and a love for all things aesthetic. And with Morin&apos;s vaunted reputation for design, and Apple&apos;s social struggles I can&apos;t think of a better home for the once-hyped app.&#xA0;Don&#x2019;t be surprised to see Apple swoop in to rescue Path from social also-ran status.</p>

But do not despair, fair founders! There are plenty of reasons why this deal is just business as usual in Silicon Valley and not the end of days.</p><p>
1. Friends Buying Friends<br>
Acquisitions tend to be chummy affair. For example, Path CEO Dave Morin invested in Hot Potato, a company run by <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150610573053034&amp;set=bc.AbrauFIa-AjJmVnXKS8ZooTkJFET3NSJyuYd32IkK_22dEsHjvxz1JOjDqzju4XW4YZrf6uAo5lKTnBju-tL6m0pdGHYojAc5rJAP-zCLrPi458IzMojZuSKoKEVwQUIZRe5w8Cpl2IiVfT_eSl7GqdJtZ4M_iWAFgpTif7SXcMAAg&amp;type=1&amp;opaqueCursor=Abp2KUaPV0DxvY_lsC0O1xjlKaJkEPfGTrX_SpPNEkDo8pmV4piIdgUVoSSRM8oJtX2ck19FwYIPbrgrVYPX8k4rIB5myVsE37WVzQeJ1W_4kHKznUOyv9RenCBP6zGaLNECyG9_2SBA7c1L_YJz-e303jesphAfj9tuTAgBTRhn8dWwdoqU-h-AP3wHU_KkD2j2BxjX6zLLkHp5Ah577icbrKe5YEcbHVX4F7HgmE5O3w&amp;theater"">his ski buddy</a> Justin Shaffer, Morin worked for Facebook, Facebook <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/28/facebook-to-pay-10-million-cash-for-hot-potato-says-source/"">acquired</a> Hot Potato. Karma, another Morin investment, was also acquired by Facebook. And Dave started his career at Apple <a href=""http://www.designerfounders.com/interviews/dave-morin-path/"">helping give out iPods</a> on college campuses. See, all in the family. </p><p>
2. Buying Cool<br>Apple, which has $150 billion in cash, has been proven itself willing to <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/articles/apple-to-buy-beats-1401308971"">buy new fans before</a> with the Beats acquisition. <em>But Path is the opposite of cool</em>, you say. That is true, but Morin has proven himself to be a savvy and <a href=""https://angel.co/syndicates"">popular angel investor</a>. In the interest of succession planning, a source told Valleywag, why wouldn&apos;t Apple let Morin rest and vest if it meant young CEOs dropping by Cupertino? &quot;He&apos;s a good exec, he&apos;s just a sub-par product person. He did well at Apple and Facebook because they had good products,&quot; added the source.</p><aside class=""link-preview""><a href=""http://online.wsj.com/articles/apple-to-buy-beats-1401308971""><p>Apple said it is buying Beats Electronics for $3 billion to bolster a music business that has lost&#x2026;</p></a></aside><p>
3. Messaging Mania<br>Silicon Valley corporations got smoked by Asian messaging apps. People like to communicate with their friends, who knew? <a href=""http://pando.com/2014/09/09/source-apple-set-to-acquire-path-in-an-attempt-to-bolster-ios-social-cred/"">Pando says</a> that&apos;s part of Apple&apos;s renewed interest in social:</p><blockquote><p>According to our source, this is more than just a talent acquisition, or acquihire. The Path product will likely survive the acquisition and be incorporated, in whole or in part, into Apple&apos;s newly refreshed Messages app. That doesn&apos;t mean that the deal will be priced like some other recent high-profile mobile communication deals, namely Facebook&apos;s $19 billion Whatsapp acquisition and rumored $3 billion-plus offers extended to Snapchat by Facebook and Google.</p><p>Facebook paid $42 per Whatsapp user, and $33 per Instagram user before that. By comparison, Rakuten bought the far less beloved Viber for just $3 per user. </p></blockquote><p>Perhaps we&apos;ll hear more about the price tag when Morin <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/events/disrupt-sf-2014/agenda/"">takes the stage</a> at TechCrunch Disrupt in less than an hour. </p><p>4. No One Even Expects Acquisitions to Succeed<br>Selling out <a href=""http://www.thebolditalic.com/articles/5674-the-unexpected-bummers-of-getting-acquired"">can be a bummer</a> not just for those in golden handcuffs, but for the buyers, says Pando:</p><aside class=""link-preview""><a href=""http://www.thebolditalic.com/articles/5674-the-unexpected-bummers-of-getting-acquired""></a></aside><blockquote><p>Apple hasn&apos;t fared much better in the social realm historically, having flopped with its Ping social network and having made very little out of its acquisition of the team and IP from failed location-based photo social network, Color.</p></blockquote><p>There, feel better?</p><p>

</p> <p> So what will Apple be getting when it acquires Path? Here&apos;s a guide.
</p> <h3> Path Is A Private Social Network
</h3> <p> One of Path&apos;s most unique features is just how much power it gives users over who can see their posts. Users are limited to just 150 friends, with no option to share posts publicly.
</p> <p> <span class=""KonaFilter image-container display-table image on-image""> <img src=""http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/54102aab69bedd5c14c92c15-539-524/img_3876.jpg"" alt=""Path screenshot""> <span class=""source-only source"">Path</span> </span> </p> <p> As well as sharing posts to their friends, Path users can also create an &quot;Inner Circle&quot; of friends who can see their most private posts.
</p> <p> <span class=""KonaFilter image-container display-table image on-image""> <img src=""http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/54102a58ecad04a312123b38-547-644/img_3881-4.jpg"" alt=""Path screenshot showing the Inner Circle function""> <span class=""source-only source"">Path</span> </span> </p> <h3> Polished Design
</h3> <p> <span class=""KonaFilter image-container display-table image on-image""> <img src=""http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/54101cb569beddcd58c92c13-640-960/img_3878-2.jpg"" alt=""Patch screenshot showing design elements""> <span class=""source-only source"">Path</span> </span> </p> <p> Path is often praised for its design, with Apple even featuring the social network in keynote slides. The app includes minimalist navigation icons and clock hands that spin as you scroll through the timeline.
</p> <h3> The New Ping?
</h3> <p> Apple&apos;s short-lived iTunes Ping service allowed users to share the music they were listening to, as well as keep track of famous musicians. Shuttered two years after its launch, the app failed to gain a significant number of users.
</p> <p> <span class=""KonaFilter image-container display-table image on-image""> <img src=""http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/541022b76bb3f72b27123b2a-640-526/img_3880-1.jpg"" alt=""Path screenshot showing U2 song music post""> <span class=""source-only source"">Path</span> </span> </p> <p> But a major feature of Path is very similar to Apple&apos;s Ping service. The app offers the ability to share what music you&apos;re listening to with friends.
</p> <h3> It Lets You Share What Time You Go To Sleep
</h3> <p> One of Path&apos;s more unique features is the ability to share what times you go to sleep and wake up. Tap the sleep button, and Path will ask you whether you&apos;re conscious or not.
</p> <p> <span class=""KonaFilter image-container display-table image""> <img src=""http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/5410247f6da8113c26100140-640-333/img_3886-2.jpg"" alt=""Patch screenshot""> <span class=""source-only source"">Path</span> </span> </p> <p> Select &quot;Go to Sleep&quot; and the app shows a night sky and a moon to get you in the mood.
</p> <p> <span class=""KonaFilter image-container display-table image on-image""> <img src=""http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/541024f869bedd6271c92c22-640-802/img_3888-1.jpg"" alt=""Path screenshot showing the app in sleep mode""> <span class=""source-only source"">Path</span> </span> </p> <p> When you wake up, tap the &quot;Awake&quot; button next to the sun icon to inform all of your Path friends that you are awake.
</p> <p> <span class=""KonaFilter image-container display-table image on-image""> <img src=""http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/5410259b6da811e42c100152-640-669/img_3889-3.jpg"" alt=""Path screenshot showing sleep updates""> <span class=""source-only source"">Path</span> </span> </p> <h3> Share Your Battery Level With Friends
</h3> <p> Path&apos;s latest update was the launch of a new messaging app in June. Path Talk lets you messages your Path friends, as well as share a whole load of information about yourself through the app.&#xA0;
</p> <p> <span class=""KonaFilter image-container display-table image on-image""> <img src=""http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/54102985ecad04ab16123b2a-640-743/img_3890-1.jpg"" alt=""Path Talk screenshot""> <span class=""source-only source"">Path</span> </span> </p> <p> As well as sensing when you&apos;re traveling on trains and in cars, the app can also continually broadcast your battery level.
</p> <p> <span class=""KonaFilter image-container display-table image on-image""> <img src=""http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/54102c1d69bedda222c92c11-492-385/img_3891-3.jpg"" alt=""Path Talk screenshot""> <span class=""source-only source"">Path</span> </span> </p> <h3> There Are Loads Of In-App Purchases
</h3> <p> Currently, Path earns money by selling virtual stickers and photo filters.
</p> <p> <span class=""KonaFilter image-container display-table image on-image""> <img src=""http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/541026986bb3f7f533123b2a-640-498/img_3883-1.jpg"" alt=""Path screenshot showing its virtual sticker store""> <span class=""source-only source"">Path</span> </span> </p> <p> The app also sells a &quot;Premium&quot; subscription that gives you unlimited virtual stickers and photo filters.

http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/09/10/rumor-apple-in-talks-to-buy-messaging-app-path,Rumor: Apple in late-stage talks to buy Path social platform,"AppleInsider Staff Tuesday, September 09, 2014, 10:46 pm PT (01:46 am ET)",,"<div><span class=""article-leader"">According to a report late Tuesday, Apple is on the verge of announcing an acquisition of social network and corresponding app Path, possibly in a bid to restart a branded platform after the failure of Ping. <br></span><br><div><a href=""http://appleinsider.com/l/?link=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/path/id403639508?mt=8""><div class=""article-img""><img src=""http://photos2.insidercdn.com/v9/images/1x1-white.jpg"" alt=""snoop"" class=""lazy lazy""></div></a></div><p>
As reported by <em>Pando Daily</em>, a source with knowledge of the matter claims <a href=""http://pando.com/2014/09/09/source-apple-set-to-acquire-path-in-an-attempt-to-bolster-ios-social-cred/"">an agreement</a> between Apple and <a href=""http://appleinsider.com/l/?link=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/path/id403639508?mt=8"">Path</a> is &quot;essentially a done deal.&quot; The publication cites one person currently working for Apple in unnamed engineering department.</p><p>
Interestingly, the source says Apple is looking to keep Path intact following the rumored buyout, a tactic that strays from the company&apos;s usual M&amp;A tactics. Save for the recent acquisition <a href=""http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/05/28/apple-buys-beats-electronics-for-3-billion-iovine-and-young-to-join-company"">of Beats</a>, Apple usually performs so-called &quot;acquihires,&quot; or purchases made for talent, not a brand name. The publication speculates that Path may make its way into iOS Messages. </p>
Path, which has been frequently featured in the iOS App Store, is not unlike a mobile-only version of Facebook. Users can share photos, videos, audio messages, and thoughts with their friends, who can reply with fine-grained emotions &#x2014; friends can express shock at a post, for instance, or &quot;love&quot; rather than simply &quot;liking&quot; the content. In addition, Path users can simultaneously share &quot;moments&quot; with their other social networks, putting Path at the middle of their social sharing endeavors.<p>
The company has also recently spun off its in-app messaging feature as a standalone app called <a href=""http://appleinsider.com/l/?link=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/path-talk/id867760913?mt=8""><em>Path Talk</em></a>, which competes with &quot;over the top&quot; messenger apps like WhatsApp and Kik.</p><p><em>Pando Daily</em> also points out that Path cofounder Dave Morin was seen sitting in the front row at Flint Center for Tuesday&apos;s iPhone 6 keynote. Apple saves those seats for high-ranking executives and special guests. For example, during the presentation, Jony Ive was seen sitting with design superstar and <a href=""http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/09/05/apple-hires-designer-marc-newson-will-assist-jony-ive-on-"">new Apple employee</a> Marc Newson.</p>
Pricing went unmentioned, but the struggling social networking firm&apos;s recent round of funding reportedly clocked in at a sub-$400 million valuation, much less than a rumored $500 million valuation sought by executives. Further, Path is not a high-ranking title in the iOS App Store and currently sits below the top-1,000 downloaded apps.<p>
Aside from being one of the less popular social networking services, Path had a few missteps that drew scrutiny from governmental regulatory agencies and even Apple itself. In 2012, the firm was <a href=""http://appleinsider.com/articles/12/02/07/path_app_under_fire_for_unauthorized_address_book_upload.html"">dinged</a> for uploading users&apos; address books without permission, claiming the automated action was meant to more easily find other friends using the app. The issue snowballed into a U.S. Federal Trade Commission investigation, which was ultimately settled for $800,000 in early 2013. </p><p>
On the day Path&apos;s settlement, a researcher discover a flaw in the app&apos;s backend that <a href=""http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/02/01/path-found-to-geotag-uploaded-photos-without-user-consent-fix-coming-soon"">geotagged</a> photos uploaded by users. The problem was quickly patched, but shortly thereafter Path <a href=""http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/04/30/path-app-again-accused-of-unacceptable-address-book-access"">was again accused</a> of unacceptable contacts handling techniques. </p></div>",,,455

          <div class=""body"">Apple is said to be close to acquiring social network Path in an attempt to boost the company&apos;s social media efforts, <a href=""http://pando.com/2014/09/09/source-apple-set-to-acquire-path-in-an-attempt-to-bolster-ios-social-cred/"">reports</a> <em>PandoDaily</em>. Citing a &quot;well-placed&quot; source inside Apple&apos;s engineering team, the site notes that the deal is &quot;essentially a done deal&quot; and would see Apple integrating Path&apos;s current services into its Messages app.

<br>
Additionally, Path founder Dave Morin was seen sitting in the front row for today&apos;s special media event, which is usually reserved for high ranking executives at the company. Throughout the past few years, Apple has also featured Path in a number of its earlier advertising campaigns and keynotes for the iPhone. 
<br>

<br>
However, the social networking service caused a fair amount of controversy in 2012 when it was discovered to be uploading users&apos; entire address books to its servers without alerting users or asking for authorization. The issue <a href=""http://www.macrumors.com/2013/02/01/path-reaches-settlement-with-ftc-over-address-book-privacy-concerns/"">prompted an investigation</a> by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission as Morin was even <a href=""http://www.macrumors.com/2012/03/15/tim-cook-met-with-paths-dave-morin-over-address-book-debacle/"">summoned</a> to Apple&apos;s Cupertino headquarters to be grilled by CEO Tim Cook and other executives.
<br>

<br>
Path&apos;s last major development came in June when the company <a href=""http://blog.path.com/post/89363839677/introducing-talk"">announced</a> that it would be launching its own separate messaging app, complete with quick reply capabilities and Apple Maps integration.</div>

The company&#x2019;s current strategy for keeping its Watch running during the day is to charge it every night. However, the tech company is trying to increase the device&#x2019;s battery life before it launches in early 2015. Adding to the Watch&#x2019;s battery issue is the fact that there is no indicator for battery life on its screen.</p>
<p><strong>iOS</strong>: Users who aren&#x2019;t registered developers with Apple are <a href=""http://bgr.com/2014/09/10/how-to-install-ios-8-gm-without-a-developer-account/"">finding ways to download iOS 8 early</a>, BGR notes. A YouTube channel using the name &#x201C;iCrackUriDevice&#x201D; has released a 15-minute video that shows owners of Apple products how to get iOS 8 on their devices before the official September 17 release. The version of iOS 8 that will be put on the devices is the Golden Master version. This version was released to developers on Tuesday and is very close to the final version of the operating system that will be released next week. Those who attempt to put the GM version of iOS 8 are warned that things can go wrong when attempting the process.</p>
<p><strong>Path</strong>: &#xA0;A new rumors claims that Apple is <a href=""http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/09/10/rumor-apple-in-talks-to-buy-messaging-app-path"">near the end of negotiations to purchase the social media platform Path</a>, reports Apple Insider. A source close to the matter claims that the Apple and Path deal is practically done and that the tech company won&#x2019;t being changing the social media platform after the purchase. Path is comparable to other social media services, expect that it&#x2019;s only available on mobile devices. It lets users shares&#xA0;photos, videos, audio messages and comments with friends. It can also be used to post to other social media platforms.</p>

(NASDAQ:AAPL) plans to acquire struggling social network Path, <a href=""http://pando.com/2014/09/09/source-apple-set-to-acquire-path-in-an-attempt-to-bolster-ios-social-cred/"">a source tells Michael Carney, a West Coast Editor at PandoDaily</a>.&#xA0; &quot;It&apos;s almost done, if not signed already, but it&#x2019;s essentially a done deal,&quot; the unnamed source, who the article says is &quot;well-placed&quot; inside Apple&apos;s engineering team, says. Path co-founder <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-acquires-path-the-social-network-2014-9"">Dave Morin&apos;s attendance Tuesday at Apple&apos;s event</a> lends some credence here -- Morin posted a selfie of himself with rapper Dr. Dre from the event on Twitter.</p><blockquote class=""twitter-tweet""><p>Did not forget about Dre. <a href=""http://t.co/fWNDpFhfYr"">pic.twitter.com/fWNDpFhfYr</a></p><p>&#x2014; Dave Morin (@davemorin) <a href=""https://twitter.com/davemorin/status/509388253099601921"">September 9, 2014</a></p></blockquote><p>If Apple intends to acquire Path, known for its beautiful interface and nebulous business model, it would be the tech giant&apos;s latest attempt to gain a foothold in social. Apple has previously stumbled in this arena with a music-centric social network called Ping that went largely unused and was discontinued in 2012. So it makes sense that it might want to start with someone else&apos;s (quite functional and flashy looking) foundation to bring a native social experience to its iOS devices.</p><p>Path was founded in 2010 by ex-Facebooker Morin and Napster co-founder Shawn Fanning. In five rounds of funding to date, the company&#xA0;<a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/path"">has received $77 million in investments</a> from <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/path/investors"">40 different investors</a>.</p><p>Path was originally conceived as a companion network to Facebook for people to enjoy higher engagement with a smaller number of quality friends and contacts. It specifically limited users to 150 in-network connections as a tip of the hat <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number"">to Dunbar&apos;s number</a>, an idea in anthropology stating human brain size is such that we can only support meaningful relationships with 150 people. Where Facebook would be a place for wishing distant acquaintances a noncommittal happy birthday, Path would be specifically for sincere communications with your smaller, closer circle of friends and family.</p><p>The company released its app first on iPhone, later following up with apps for Android, Windows Phone and iPad. While it only <a href=""http://gizmodo.com/ping-redux-apple-is-reportedly-buying-private-social-1632849129"">boasts 25 million users</a>&#xA0;(a far cry from the userbase of social giants like Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat), the app is quite glamorous-looking and loaded with simple visual appeal. You might consider its news feed a list of stylized Facebook updates from people you actually want to hear from.</p><p> <span class=""figure image""> <picture width=""600"" height=""450"" class=""mapping-embed""><source srcset=""http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/embed/public/2014/09/10/path-screenshot.jpeg 1x""><source srcset=""http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/embed-md/public/2014/09/10/path-screenshot.jpeg 1x""><source srcset=""http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/embed-md/public/2014/09/10/path-screenshot.jpeg 1x""><source srcset=""http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/embed-md/public/2014/09/10/path-screenshot.jpeg 1x""><source srcset=""http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/embed-sm/public/2014/09/10/path-screenshot.jpeg 1x""><img width=""600"" class=""mapping-embed"" src=""http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/embed/public/2014/09/10/path-screenshot.jpeg"" alt=""path screenshot""></picture><meta><meta><meta> <span class=""figcaption""> <span class=""caption"">A screenshot of the Path iPad app.</span> <span class=""credit"">Photo: Path</span> </span> </span></p><p>Apple and Path already have history together. Not only is Path&apos;s Morin a former Apple employee who worked in the company&apos;s marketing and product division from 2004-2006, but Path also made a fairly major error surrounding iOS user privacy in 2012. Its app uploaded iPhone users&apos;&#xA0;<a href=""http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2399970,00.asp"">complete contact lists to its servers</a>, which led to&#xA0;<a href=""http://9to5mac.com/2012/02/15/congress-presses-apples-cook-to-come-clean-on-ios-developer-data-access-following-path-address-book-debacle/"">Apple CEO Tim Cook responding to letters from the U.S. Congress</a>&#xA0;about how Apple responds to user privacy. A&#xA0;second privacy flub in 2013 saw Path pay an $800,000 penalty to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission for storing information belonging to underage users; it agreed to independent privacy assessments every other year for the next 20 years.</p><p>Path has had its problems, but its product -- a walled garden for more-intimate socialization with your closest friends -- is strong and functional.</p><p>Apple has yet to build a social experience people want to use habitually, so this acquisition would be a sensible one. If and when it becomes official, we&apos;ll be standing by for the specifics.</p></div>",www.ibtimes.com,,537

Today, on stage at TechCrunch Disrupt, Path founder Dave Morin was <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/10/path-apple-watch/"">asked</a> about the report.</p>
<p>Morin&apos;s response was straight from the Dummies Guide To Media Training:&#xA0;&#x201C;We don&#x2019;t comment on rumors or speculation.&#x201D; When TechCrunch&apos;s Matthew&#xA0;Panzarino pointed out&#xA0;&#x201C;that&#x2019;s not a no,&#x201D; Morin repeated his response.</p>
<p>There are a couple of things to note here. For one thing, from a PR point of view, Morin&apos;s response was exactly right. If the deal is about to happen, then he&apos;s hardly going to confirm it on stage to a reporter ahead of time. If the deal isn&apos;t about to happen, Morin can still benefit from the idea that Path is still valuable to <em>someone</em>.</p>
<p>And yet, it&apos;s interesting&#xA0;how Morin&apos;s&#xA0;&quot;no comment&quot; flies in the face of a promise he made to Pando&apos;s Sarah Lacy last year about how he and Path would deal with the press in future. As Sarah <a href=""http://pando.com/2013/08/15/heres-why-path-didnt-leak-a-fake-valuation-and-you-shouldnt-either/"">explained at the time</a>:
<blockquote>I explained the problem from the journalists&#x2019; side, and asked Morin what he proposed for a publication and entrepreneurs who want to start having a fairer dialog. Not a favorable one, but a fair one. Something that helps readers more than the denial, the reporter speculation, and the rewritten press release.</blockquote></p>
<p>He said for his part he was no longer going to obfuscate anything. If a reporter gets a scoop, and it&#x2019;s accurate and he or she calls him up, he&#x2019;ll say congratulations and tell them to run with it. No more playing games.
Given Morin&apos;s response on stage today, and the fact Carney contacted him&#xA0;last night for comment but received no response, perhaps a more accurate promise would have been &quot;No more playing games, unless I&apos;m&#xA0;scared shitless of upsetting Apple.&quot;</p> </div></div>",,,310

http://www.slashgear.com/apple-may-buy-path-that-social-app-you-dont-use-10345721/,"Apple may buy Path, that social app you don’t use",,,"<div><div id=""post-prep""> <a class=""comments-count"" href=""http://www.slashgear.com/apple-may-buy-path-that-social-app-you-dont-use-10345721/#disqus""><span class=""dsq-postid"">0</span> <span></span></a> </div><div class=""content""> <p>If there&#x2019;s one thing Apple currently lacks, it&#x2019;s a good social layer to their various offerings. Perhaps to satiate our need to be digitally social, Apple is reportedly close to purchasing the nearly four-year-old Path. Insiders say the deal may already be done, too.</p> <p><br>
According to Pando Daily, one well-placed source on Apple&#x2019;s Engineering squad says <em>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s almost done, if not signed already, but it&#x2019;s essentially a done deal.&#x201D;</em> So why is Apple interested in Path, if they indeed are? In a way, they&#x2019;re kindred.</p>
<p>Path struggles to find users, but that&#x2019;s obviously not why they and Apple are so similar. If anything positive can be said of Path, it&#x2019;s with their design. They&#x2019;ve been widely lauded as a heavy-hitter when it comes to UI and experience, something Apple covets in their own right.</p>
<p><img class=""alignnone size-medium wp-image-316393"" src=""https://c.slashgear.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/path-ios-7-600x292.jpg%20600w,%20https://c.slashgear.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/path-ios-7.jpg%201180w"" alt=""path-ios-7"" width=""600"" srcset=""https://c.slashgear.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/path-ios-7-600x292.jpg 600w, https://c.slashgear.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/path-ios-7.jpg 1180w""></p>
<p>Further evidence of this comes with news that Dave Morin &#x2014; current Path CEO and former Apple employee &#x2014; was spotted sitting front and center at Apple&#x2019;s iPhone 6/Apple Watch event yesterday. That&#x2019;s a spot typically reserved for top brass and partners, not the CEO if a hit-and-miss social platform Apple has no involvement in.</p>
<p>Apple snapping up Path is also said to be more than an acquihire to get folks like Morin back in the fold. Pando&#x2019;s source says Path will survive the acquisition whole, and be cobbled (somehow, maybe lightly) into Apple&#x2019;s revamped Messaging app.</p>
<p>It seems a likely acquisition, and it will be interesting to see how Apple works Path into their fold. Path is good, but suffers the same &#x201C;ghost town&#x201D; moniker that haunts other social platforms like Google+. But hey, at least it will probably work out better than <a href=""https://www.slashgear.com/apple-to-shutter-ping-in-next-itunes-release-13233749/"">Apple&#x2019;s previous social experiment</a>, right?</p>
<p><em>Right?</em></p>

						<p>Islamic State brutes fed a distraught woman searching for her kidnapped son some meat and rice &#x2013; and then told her she had just eaten her son, according to a British man who joined the fight against ISIS.</p>
<p>Yasir Abdulla, 36, of Yorkshire left his wife and four kids to battle the maniacal extremists in his Kurdish homeland, <a href=""http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/6351852/Sick-Islamic-State-jihadis-fed-mother-her-son-says-Brit-taking-fight-to-fanatics.html"">The Sun reported</a>.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I hate IS because of what happened to an old Kurdish woman from a nearby tribe,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Her son was captured by IS fighters and taken as a prisoner to Mosul. She was determined to find her son and went to IS headquarters and asked to see him.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He said the thugs told her to rest after her long journey and offered her the food before taking her to her son.</p>
<p>&#x201C;They brought her cups of tea and fed her a meal of cooked meat, rice and soup. She thought they were kind,&#x201D; he said.&#x201C;But they had killed him and chopped him up and after she finished the meal and asked to see her son they laughed and said, &#x2018;You&#x2019;ve just eaten him,&#x2019;&#x201D; Abdulla told The Sun.</p>
<p>Abdulla decided to take on the murderous group after they came within six miles of his home in Kurdistan.</p>
<p>He said he bought combat fatigues online and an assault rifle in his Kurdish hometown &#x2013; then joined other volunteers on the front lines.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We want to attack IS and drive them out forever but we can&#x2019;t unless the Peshmerga and the Americans say we can,&#x201D; he said, referring to the military forces of Iraqi Kurdistan.</p>
<p>Abdulla described the jihadists&#x2019; terror tactics, including slaughtering prisoners in bonfires.</p>
<p>&#x201C;They dig a trench, put dry tree branches and leaves in there, set it alight and then throw prisoners on so they burn alive,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;IS are very good at making people scared. If they make one person scared then that person will make another person scared and soon everyone is scared of IS.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;But the Kurds are not scared of them. Someone has to stand and fight. We have got thousands of people in many villages and towns behind us. If we fall then all of those places fall, and that can&#x2019;t happen.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Yasir, who returned to the UK last week, remains confident and vows to return to Iraq to help the rebels defeat the fanatics.</p>

<p>He accepted, despite being married, which was the first mistake. The second and third mistakes: losing his left testicle, then his right testicle when this mysterious woman <a href=""http://static.tvtome.com/images/genie_images/story/2012_usa/j/justified_deweybath.jpg"">pulled a Dewey Crowe</a> on him.</p>

<p>He woke up next day at a bus stop, feeling acute pain, and with blood on his trousers.</p>
<p>Rushed to hospital, he was told that his testicles had been removed and that &#x201C;it was done like proper surgery by someone with a medical education.&#x201D; The operation was conducted in a &#x201C;skillful way,&#x201D; said police, who believe his beer was spiked by an unknown drug.

He is believed to have traveled to Syria around 2012 and to have later joined the Islamic State, the group whose barbarity he has come to symbolize.</p> <p> <i> <a href=""http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/world/the-islamic-states-atrocities/1608/"">[View: The atrocities of the Islamic State]</a> </i> </p> <p>&#x201C;I have no doubt that Mohammed is Jihadi John,&#x201D; said one of Emwazi&#x2019;s close friends who identified him in an interview with The Washington Post. &#x201C;He was like a brother to me. .&#x2009;.&#x2009;.

Ideology clearly plays a big role in motivating some men to participate in jihadist causes. </p><p> &quot;British fighters have clearly demonstrated that they are not in this conflict to take a back seat.

</p> <p> Born in Kuwait, Emwazi comes from a &quot;well-to-do family&quot; in West London and studied computer science at the University of Westminster.
</p> <p> The Post talked to multiple friends of Emwazi&apos;s who identified him as the jihadist militant responsible for the graphic beheadings of James Foley, Steven Sotloff, and others. Wearing a mask to obscure his identity, the executioner became known by his distinctive British accent, and he was dubbed &quot;Jihadi John&quot; by the media.
</p> <p> Emwazi became radicalised after graduating from University, and he was known to authorities. He had been stopped and quizzed twice by security services, <a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/british-muslims-on-safari-stopped-by-mi5-1959610.html""> once in Tanzania</a> and again in Britain. This first detention frustrated Emwazi, according to one friend, who said, &quot;Mohammed was quite incensed by his treatment, that he had been very unfairly treated.&quot; An MI5 agent reportedly subsequently tried to &quot;recruit&quot; Emwazi.
</p> <p> He then moved to Kuwait, and was detained again when returning to Britain to finalise a marriage, and could not subsequently leave. Emwazi wrote to the friend saying that he felt &quot;like a prisoner, only not in a cage, in London.&quot; In 2010, he filed a complaint with the Independent Police Complaints Commission, <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/26/uk-man-behind-isis-beheadings-named-as-mohammed-emwazi-jihadi-john""> according to the Guardian</a>.
</p> <p> Emwazi is believed to have travelled to Syria in 2012, where he became responsible for guarding prisoners for Islamic State, the militant Jihadist group also known as ISIS or ISIL that now controls large swathes of the country and Iraq. <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-31637090"">The BBC reports that</a> British security services have previously chosen not to disclose Emwazi&apos;s name for &quot;operational reasons.&quot;
</p> <p><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/26/uk-man-behind-isis-beheadings-named-as-mohammed-emwazi-jihadi-john""> The Guardian reports that Emwazi</a> &quot;had a penchant for wearing stylish clothes but remained an observant Muslim.&quot;
</p> <p> Asim Querishi, a spokesperson for advocacy group CAGE, held a press conference about Emwazi. <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/islamic-state/11436615/Jihadi-John-named-as-Mohammed-Emwazi-live.html""> He says that he knew him since 2009</a>, and he is a &quot;beautiful young man,&quot; and that while Emwazi&apos;s family were aware that he travelled to Syria, they do not believe he is &quot;Jihadi John.&quot;&#xA0;

<p class=""story-body-text story-content"">LONDON &#x2014; Mohammed Emwazi was 6 when his parents moved to West London from his birthplace in Kuwait, and he seems to have lived a normal life, studying hard and graduating in computer sciences from the University of Westminster in 2009.</p><p class=""story-body-text story-content"">But he came to the attention of the British intelligence services in May that same year, detained as he landed in Tanzania with two friends on what he described as a celebratory safari. British officials thought he and his friends were headed to Somalia, to fight with the <a href=""http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/s/al-shabab/index.html?inline=nyt-org"" class=""meta-org"">Shabab</a> terrorist group and allegedly tried to recruit him as an informant before shipping him back home.</p><p class=""story-body-text story-content"">Mr. Emwazi was identified on Thursday as the masked Islamic State fighter called &#x201C;Jihadi John,&#x201D; and his journey from computer student to a murderous spokesman for the Islamic State is only beginning to come clear. How and when he was radicalized, and whether the British intelligence services were at fault &#x2014; either dealing with him too harshly or not identifying him as a serious threat soon enough &#x2014; are already the subjects of hot debate.</p><p class=""story-body-text story-content"">The question for security services is the same all over the West, whether in <a href=""http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/unitedkingdom/index.html?inline=nyt-geo"" class=""meta-loc"">Britain</a>, France or now in the United States, as some young Muslims are becoming radicalized or seeking to join a jihad. Given important constitutional and legal protections, how do counterterrorism and police officials draw the line when they find enough evidence to suspect someone, but do not have enough to prosecute them, or even to keep them under legal surveillance?</p>

<div class=""story-body-supplemental"">
    <div class=""story-body story-body-2"">
        <p class=""story-body-text story-content"" id=""story-continues-2"">&#x201C;Doing nothing is not practical or acceptable under today&#x2019;s conditions,&#x201D; said Shashank Joshi, a senior research fellow at Royal United Services Institute, a British research institution.</p> 
<p class=""story-body-text story-content"">Mr. Emwazi was called Jihadi John by the foreign hostages he guarded, a number of whom he apparently beheaded in widely circulated videos. He was first identified on Thursday <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/jihadi-john-the-islamic-state-killer-behind-the-mask-is-a-young-londoner/2015/02/25/d6dbab16-bc43-11e4-bdfa-b8e8f594e6ee_story.html"">by the Washington Post website</a>, and his name was confirmed by a senior British security official. The official said that the British government had identified Mr. Emwazi some time ago but had not disclosed his name for operational reasons. The identification was also confirmed in Washington by a senior United States military intelligence official.</p><p class=""story-body-text story-content"">Information about Mr. Emwazi is still vague, with Britain officially refusing to confirm that he is indeed &#x201C;Jihadi John&#x201D; because of what are described as continuing operations.</p>
<p class=""story-body-text story-content"" id=""story-continues-3"">But Mr. Emwazi appears in 2011 court documents, <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-31641569"">obtained by the BBC</a>, as a member of a network of extremists who funneled funds, equipment and recruits &#x201C;from the United Kingdom to Somalia to undertake terrorism-related activity.&#x201D;</p><p class=""story-body-text story-content"">Mr. Emwazi is alleged to be part of a group from West and North London, sometimes known as the North London Boys, with links to the Shabab terrorist group from Somalia, organized by an individual who had returned to London in February 2007 and whose name was redacted in court documents.</p><p class=""story-body-text story-content"">Another person associated with that group was Bilal al-Berjawi, who was born in Lebanon but brought to West London as a baby. He fought in Somalia and rose through the ranks of the Shabab and Al Qaeda in Africa before being killed in a drone strike in January 2012, according to Raffaello Pantucci, also a fellow at the Royal United Services Institute.</p><p class=""story-body-text story-content"">Mr. Berjawi traveled to Kenya in February 2009, telling his family he was heading for a safari; he and a friend were detained in Nairobi and shipped back to London, but made it to Somalia in October that year.</p><p class=""story-body-text story-content"">The neighborhood group &#x201C;is a tight community and it&#x2019;s very probable that they knew each other and were part of the same crew,&#x201D; Mr. Pantucci said.</p><p class=""story-body-text story-content"">So it is likely that Mr. Emwazi&#x2019;s own safari a few months later in May, from Britain to Germany to Tanzania, when he used the name Muhammad ibn Muazzam, set off alarms with the British security services, and that he had started on the road to radicalism even before his encounter with MI5 in 2009.</p><p class=""story-body-text story-content"">Asim Qureshi, research director at <a href=""http://www.cageuk.org/about"">CAGE, a British advocacy organization</a> opposed to what it calls the &#x201C;war on terror,&#x201D; met with Mr. Emwazi in the fall of 2009. Mr. Emwazi was very angry over his treatment at the hands of British security services, Mr. Qureshi said, and the two stayed in contact for two years.</p>
<p class=""story-body-text story-content"">Mr. Qureshi said he was not 100 percent sure that Mr. Emwazi, whom he described as &#x201C;extremely kind, extremely humble and extremely soft-spoken,&#x201D; was the masked Islamic State terrorist.</p>
<p class=""story-body-text story-content"" id=""story-continues-4"">But he nonetheless blamed Mr. Emwazi&#x2019;s treatment for his radicalization, describing harassment by police officers at airports, pressure on Kuwait to cancel a visa and on one occasion, Mr. Emwazi&#x2019;s being &#x201C;roughed up&#x201D; and &#x201C;strangled by a police officer&#x201D; before being sent home.</p><p class=""story-body-text story-content"">&#x201C;This is not somebody who ever said, &#x2018;I hate the system, I reject the system,&#x2019; &#x201D; Mr. Qureshi said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s someone who said, &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t like the environment but I&#x2019;ll work within the system to effect change.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p>

<p class=""story-body-text story-content"">As ever, there are conflicting interpretations, with some seeing a young Muslim man treated badly, put into a headlock, barred from traveling and induced to betray his friends, and those who say that such treatment is not any excuse, or reason, for repeatedly cutting off the heads of civilians taken hostage.</p><p class=""story-body-text story-content"">Further, there are others who are wondering how security services can identify potential terrorists like Mr. Emwazi, but then fail to recognize what risk they pose.</p><p class=""story-body-text story-content"">The CAGE group, which embraces its notoriety, emphasized similar circumstances in the case of <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/20/world/europe/2-found-guilty-in-killing-of-british-soldier.html"">Michael Adebolajo</a>, who hacked to death a British soldier, Lee Rigby, outside a London barracks in May 2013.</p><p class=""story-body-text story-content"">Mr. Adebolajo claimed that he had been detained in Kenya and tortured by British officials who suspected that he was traveling to Somalia to join the Shabab, and that MI5 also tried to turn him into an informer.</p><p class=""story-body-text story-content"">Mr. Emwazi, returning from Tanzania, was detained again at an airport in the Netherlands and questioned by Dutch and British security officials.</p><p class=""story-body-text story-content"">Mr. Emwazi later moved to Kuwait, his birthplace, working for a computer company, and he returned to London at least twice, Mr. Qureshi said. British counterterrorism officials detained Mr. Emwazi in June 2010, fingerprinting him and searching his belongings. In July of that year, Mr. Qureshi said, Mr. Emwazi was not allowed to return to Kuwait, which had apparently refused to renew his visa, and Mr. Emwazi blamed the British government.</p> 
<p class=""story-body-text story-content"">&#x201C;I had a job waiting for me and marriage to get started,&#x201D; he wrote in a 2010 email to Mr. Qureshi. &#x201C;But now I feel like a prisoner, only not in a cage, in London.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x200B;Jihadi John&#xA0;fronted gruesome ISIS videos that showed either the killing or bodies of victims including U.S. citizens James Foley, Steven Sotloff and Peter Kassig, Britons David Haines and Alan Henning, Japanese Kenji Goto and over 20 Syrian soldiers.</p> <p>He was unmasked publicly for the first time on Friday by British media which published a photograph showing Emwazi as a schoolboy.</p> <p>The Daily Mail newspaper published a picture showing Emwazi smiling and sitting cross-legged on the grass at the front of the photograph from the St Mary Magdalene Church of England primary school in Maida Vale, West London.</p> <h2>Known to British intelligence</h2> <p>Emwazi was born in Kuwait but came to Britain aged 6 and graduated with a computer programming degree from the University of Westminster before coming to the attention of Britain&apos;s main domestic intelligence service, MI5, according to an account given by Asim Qureshi, the research director of the Cage charity that campaigns for those detained on terrorism charges.</p> <p>Emwazi, a fluent Arabic speaker, said MI5 had tried to recruit him and then prevented him from travelling abroad, forcing him to flee abroad without telling his family, Qureshi told a news conference in London.</p> <p>Emwazi travelled to Syria around 2012, Qureshi said.</p> <p>MI5 does not publicly comment on the identity of militants or their backgrounds while an investigation is still ongoing. The British government and police declined to confirm or deny Emwazi&apos;s identity, citing an ongoing security investigation.</p> <p>&quot;We don&apos;t confirm or deny matters relating to intelligence,&quot; said a spokeswoman for Cameron, who has ordered spy agencies and soldiers to track down the killer.</p> <p>Jihadi John&#xA0;rose to notoriety in August 2014 when a video appeared showing a masked man raging against the United States before apparently beheading U.S. citizen James Foley off camera.</p> <p>Intelligence services in the U.S. and Britain used a variety of investigative techniques including voice and facial recognition as well as interviews with former hostages to identify the man, intelligence sources said.</p> <p>But security officials made great efforts to avoid publicly naming Emwazi, fearing that would make him more difficult to catch. Two intelligence sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said they were uneasy that the name had been revealed.</p> <h2>Al-Shabaab connection</h2> <p>There was no answer at two addresses in west London where Emwazi was listed to have lived. Neighbours described the family as &quot;normal people&quot; and &quot;friendly&quot;.</p> <p>&quot;This is the first time anything like this happens in this neighbourhood,&quot; said Fatima Al-Baqali. &quot;We have to be careful now. I didn&apos;t know this family and I usually know everyone here.&quot;</p> <div class=""figure col4width floatright""> <img src=""https://i.cbc.ca/1.2743044.1408640252!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/american-syria.jpg"" alt=""American-Syria"" width=""100%""> <p class=""figure-caption"">A man believed to be Emwazi is seen here with American journalist James Foley, whose beheading was filmed by ISIS.

</div>
<p>Qureshi, of the Cage charity which describes itself as having campaigned against the &apos;War on Terror&apos; for more than a decade, said that although he could not be certain Emwazi was John, there were some &quot;striking similarities&quot;. He declined to elaborate.</p> <p>In a meeting with reporters in London, Qureshi painted a picture of a kind and thoughtful young man who faced harassment from MI5, which apparently suspected he wanted to join the Somali militant group al-Shabaab.</p> <p>British authorities have linked Emwazi to another British militant killed in Somalia in a U.S. drone attack.</p> <p>A British court ruling dated December 2011 reported that Elwazi was an associate of Bilal al Berjawi, a high-ranking leader of the Somali-based militant group al-Shabaab, a person in possession of the court ruling said.</p> <h2>Detained by MI5</h2> <p>Qureshi said British spies had tried to recruit Emwazi as a source but declined to provide specifics.</p> <p>&quot;There&apos;s one character that I remember, one kind person that I remember and then I see that image and there doesn&apos;t seem to be a correlation between the two,&quot; Qureshi told reporters.</p> <p>&quot;I feel like a prisoner, only not in a cage, in London,&quot; Emwazi wrote in an email to Cage.</p> <p>He felt like &quot;a person imprisoned and controlled by security service men, (who) stopping me from living my new life in my birthplace and my country, Kuwait&quot;.</p> <p>Cage said Emwazi was detained in Tanzania, where he went for a safari holiday with two friends in August 2009.</p> <p>He was deported to Amsterdam and interrogated by MI5 and a Dutch intelligence officer and then sent back to Britain, according to Qureshi.</p> <p>Reuters was unable to immediately verify the version of events given by the charity, which provoked criticism for shifting the responsibility for Emwazi&apos;s crimes.</p> <h2>Tried to return to Kuwait</h2> <p>&quot;I think this is an attempt to deflect attention from Jihadi John,&quot; said Shiraz Maher, Senior Fellow at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation, King&apos;s College London.</p> <p>&quot;They&apos;re trying to lay the blame for this at the feet of the British government,&quot; he told Sky news.</p> <p>The Cage charity, which also worked with the family of Michael Adebolajo, the Muslim covert who with an accomplice killed a British soldier in London in May 2013, said both men had been victims of undue pressure from the security services.</p> <p>Britain&apos;s MI5 security service was not immediately available for comment on those allegations. MI5 has argued to British lawmakers that it would be damaging to national security to comment on allegations that is sought to recruit Adebolajo.</p> <p>The British Parliament&apos;s Intelligence and Security Committee said last year that MI5 had investigated Adebolajo five times, twice as a high priority, but had found no evidence that any attack was being planned.</p> <p>The Committee said it had found no evidence that Adebolajo was harassed by MI5.</p> <p>After becoming frustrated following three failed attempts to return to Kuwait, and changing his name to Mohammed al-Ayan, Emwazi left his parents&apos; home and slipped out of Britain, according to Qureshi.</p> <p>Four months later, police visited the family home to say they had information he had entered Syria. His family thought he was in Turkey doing aid work.</p> </div>",www.cbc.ca,,1189

<p>His friend added that he&#xA0;was radicalised after a planned trip to Tanzania following his graduation.</p>
<p>British radicalisation experts said they believed the identity to be &#x2018;accurate and correct&#x2019;.</p>
<p>A statement from the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation (ICSR) at King&#x2019;s College London said: &#x2018;We believe the identity and name published by the Washington Post and now in the public realm to be accurate and correct.&#x2019;</p> <p>Dressed all in black with a balaclava covering all but his eyes and the ridge of his nose and a holster under his left arm, &#x2018;Jihadi John&#x2019; reappeared in videos of the beheadings of US journalist Steven Sotloff, British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning, and American aid worker Peter Kassig.</p>
<p>And last month, the militant appeared in a video with the Japanese hostages Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto, shortly before they were killed.</p>
<p>A detailed Washington Post article claims Jihadi John is in fact Kuwaiti-born Emwazi, who it says travelled to Syria around 2012 before later joining IS, which has taken control of large swathes of the conflict-torn country, as well as territory in neighbouring Iraq.</p>

</div>
<p>The article claims Emwazi started to radicalise after a planned safari in Tanzania following his graduation from the University of Westminster was brought to an abrupt end when he was detained on arrival in Dar es Salaam and deported the following day.</p>
<p>It is claimed that he told friends he was flown to Amsterdam where an officer from MI5 accused him of trying to reach Somalia, where the militant group al-Shabab operates.</p>
<p>According to the article, in 2009/2010, Emwazi decided to move to Kuwait, where he told friends he had a job and marriage waiting for him &#x2013; but was prevented from travelling there by UK counter-terrorism officials.</p> <p>Released hostages have told officials that Jihadi John was part of a team guarding Western captives at a prison in Idlib, Syria, in 2013. He was joined by two other men with British accents, including one who was dubbed &#x2018;George&#x2019;.</p>
<p>The ICSR said: &#x2018;Jihadi John is not special in the sense that all the foreign fighters have tried to hide their identity by using pseudonyms or literally by masking themselves.</p>
<p>&#x2018;The fact that &#x2018;Jihadi John&#x2019; has been unveiled in this manner demonstrates that whatever efforts are made, the ability to mask one&#x2019;s identity is limited or in fact impossible, and their true identities will eventually be revealed.</p>
<p>&#x2018;This demonstrates what we have long said about radicalisation, that it is not something driven by poverty or social deprivation. Ideology clearly plays a big role in motivating some men to participate in jihadist causes.</p>
<p>&#x2018;British fighters have clearly demonstrated that they are not in this conflict to take a back seat. They are full participants in this war, operating as suicide bombers, hostage takers, and executioners.&#x2019;</p>
<p>Scotland Yard has refused to confirm the reports.</p>
<p>Commander Richard Walton, head of the Met&#x2019;s counter terrorism command, said: &#x2018;We have previously asked media outlets not to speculate about the details of our investigation on the basis that life is at risk.</p>
<p>&#x2018;We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter-terrorism investigation.&#x2019;</p>
<p>Downing Street declined to confirm or deny that the reported name was known to the intelligence and security services.</p>
<p>Asked if David Cameron was concerned about Emwazi&#x2019;s name being reported, a No 10 spokeswoman said: &#x2018;The Prime Minister would be concerned about information being put into the public domain at any time that might jeopardise ongoing police or security investigations or the safety of British citizens.</p>
<p>&#x2018;There is an ongoing investigation. It is absolutely right that we allow the police and security agencies to do all they can to bring those responsible to justice and to help keep British people safe.&#x2019;</p> </div>",metro.co.uk,,881

</div></div><p>Abu Talib and Muhammad ibn Muazzam, both in their mid-20s, and a German friend travelling with them, allege they were threatened with beatings by members of Tanzania&apos;s security forces. After being refused entry to Tanzania they were returned to the Netherlands, where they say they were questioned by MI5 agents who accused them of having links to Islamic extremists.</p><p>On their return to the UK the next day, the men allege they were harassed by MI5, who warned them they were now on a terror watch list which prevented them travelling to any Muslim country. Another British citizen, Abu Omar, 19, says that in April 2009 his safari holiday to Kenya was interrupted when the house in which he was staying was raided by local security officers.</p><p>Mr Omar claims he was held and questioned for four days, also on the basis of intelligence supplied by MI5. He alleges that his interrogators threw a mobile phone at him which they said had his fingerprints on and was linked to phone calls made to Osama bin Laden. Back in London Mr Omar was further questioned by MI5, who took his fingerprints and photographs.</p><div class=""dnd-widget-wrapper context-sdl_editor_representation type-image""><div class=""dnd-atom-rendered""><div class=""image""><img src=""https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_medium/public/thumbnails/image/2015/02/26/16/asim-qureshi.jpg"" width=""564"" alt=""asim-qureshi.jpg""></div></div><div class=""dnd-caption-wrapper"">CAGE research director, Asim Qureshi (AP)</div></div><p> He told the human rights group Cageprisoners: &quot;I was left in the airport without money, barefoot and my clothes in bin liners.&quot;</p><p>The new cases bear striking similarities to allegations made by six youth workers from Kentish Town who allege that they too were harassed and unlawfully interrogated after holidays abroad in 2008.

Emwazi&apos;s family declined a request for an interview, citing legal advice.</p><p>The Kuwaiti-born Emwazi, in his mid-20s, appears to have left little trail on social media or elsewhere online. Those who knew him say he was polite and had a penchant for wearing stylish clothes while adhering to the tenets of his Islamic faith. He had a beard and was mindful of making eye contact with women, friends said.</p><p>He was raised in a middle-class neighbourhood in London and on occasion prayed at a mosque in Greenwich.</p><p>The friends, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the investigation, believe that Emwazi started to radicalise after a planned safari in Tanzania following his graduation from the University of Westminster.</p><p>Emwazi and two friends &#x2014; a German convert to Islam named Omar and another man, Abu Talib &#x2014; never made it on the trip. Once they landed in Dar es Salaam, in May 2009, they were detained by police and held overnight. It&apos;s unclear whether the reason for the detention was made clear to the three, but they were eventually deported.</p><p>Emwazi flew to Amsterdam, where he claimed that an officer from MI5, Britain&apos;s domestic security agency, accused him of trying to reach Somalia, where the militant group al-Shabab operates in the southern part of the country, according to emails that he sent to Qureshi and that were provided to <i>The Post</i>.</p><p>Emwazi denied the accusation and claimed that MI5 representatives had tried to recruit him. But a former hostage said &apos;Jihadi John&apos; was obsessed with Somalia and made his captives watch videos about al-Shabab, which is allied with al-Qaeda.</p><p>The episode was described in the <i>Independent</i>, a British newspaper, which identified Emwazi as Muhammad ibn Muazzam.</p><p>Emwazi and his friends were allowed to return to Britain, where he met with Qureshi in the autumn of 2009 to discuss what had happened. &quot;Mohammed was quite incensed by his treatment, that he had been very unfairly treated,&quot; Qureshi said.</p><p>Shortly afterward, Emwazi decided to move to his birthplace, Kuwait, where he landed a job working for a computer company, according to the emails he wrote to Qureshi. He came back to London twice, the second time to finalise his wedding plans to a woman in Kuwait.</p><p>In June 2010, however, counterterrorism officials in Britain detained him again &#x2014; this time fingerprinting him and searching his belongings. When he tried to fly back to Kuwait the next day, he was prevented from doing so.</p><p>&quot;I had a job waiting for me and marriage to get started,&quot; he wrote in a June 2010 email to Qureshi. But now &quot;I feel like a prisoner, only not in a cage, in London. A person imprisoned &amp; controlled by security service men, stopping me from living my new life in my birthplace &amp; country, Kuwait.&quot;</p><p>Nearly four months later, when a court in New York sentenced Aafia Siddiqui, an al-Qaeda operative convicted for the attempted murder of US personnel in Afghanistan, Emwazi expressed sympathy for her, saying he had &quot;heard the upsetting news regarding our sister. .&#x2009;.&#x2009;. This should only keep us firmer towards fighting for freedom and justice!!!&quot;</p><p>In the interview, Qureshi said he last heard from Emwazi in January 2012, when Emwazi sent him an email seeking advice.</p><p>&quot;This is a young man who was ready to exhaust every single kind of avenue within the machinery of the state to bring a change for his personal situation,&quot; Qureshi said. In the end, he felt &quot;actions were taken to criminalise him and he had no way to do something against these actions.&quot;</p><p>Close friends of Emwazi&apos;s also said his situation in London had made him desperate to leave the country. It&apos;s unclear exactly when he reached Syria or how.</p><p>One friend said he believed Emwazi wanted to travel to Saudi Arabia to teach English in 2012 but was unsuccessful. Soon afterward, the friend said, he was gone.</p><p>&quot;He was upset and wanted to start a life elsewhere,&quot; one of the friends said. &quot;He at some stage reached the point where he was really just trying to find another way to get out.&quot;</p><p>Once in Syria, Emwazi contacted his family and at least one of his friends. It&apos;s unclear what he told them about his activities there.</p><p>A former hostage who was debriefed by officials upon release said that &apos;Jihadi John&apos; was part of a team guarding Western captives at a prison in Idlib, Syria, in 2013. The hostages nicknamed the facility &quot;the box&quot;. Emwazi was joined by two other men with British accents, including one who was dubbed &quot;George&quot;. A former hostage said Emwazi participated in the waterboarding of four Western hostages.</p><p>Former hostages described George as the leader of the trio. &apos;Jihadi John&apos;, they said, was quiet and intelligent. &quot;He was the most deliberate,&quot; a former hostage said.</p><p>Beginning in early 2014, the hostages were moved to a prison in the Syrian city of Raqqa, the Islamic State&apos;s de facto capital, where they were visited often by the trio. They appeared to have taken on more powerful roles within the Islamic State.</p><p>About the same time, Qureshi said, he sent an email to Emwazi.</p><p>&quot;I was wondering if you could send me your number,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Inshallah [God willing] it will be good to catch up.&quot;</p><p>There was no response.</p><p><b>The Washington Post</b></p></div>",www.smh.com.au,,1404

<p>According to <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/jihadi-john-the-islamic-state-killer-behind-the-mask-is-a-young-londoner/2015/02/25/d6dbab16-bc43-11e4-bdfa-b8e8f594e6ee_story.html?hpid=z1"">The Washington Post</a>, Mohammed Emwazi grew up in a well-to-do family in west London. He is believed to have traveled to Syria around 2012 and to have later joined the militant group.</p>
<p>Channel 4 News has spoken people who knew him at his school and another who says they were with him in the first weeks he was in Syria.</p>
<p>Contemporaries of his at the Quintin Kynaston Academy in west London describe as quiet, intelligent and hard-working. They say he cared for his younger siblings &#x2013; and was religious though not unduly so.</p> <p>One of Emwazi&#x2019;s former teachers spoke anonymously to Channel 4 News.</p>
<p>She remembered a &#x201C;diligent, hardworking, lovely young man&#x201D; who was responsible, polite and quiet.</p>
<p>Expressing her shock at the path his life had taken, she recalled: &#x201C;he was somebody who would always seek the correct way of handling something and when there were any issues, he would come and speak to teachers like me and ask to help him sort things out, he did things in the right way.</p>
<p>&#x201C;There was never any indication of any kind of violence at all.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He graduated with a degree in computer programming from the University of Westminster. A contemporary said he was often seen in the prayer room between classes.</p>
<h2>&#x2018;I am sure it is him&#x2019;<br>
</h2>
<p>Channel 4 News has also spoken to a source who says he met and spent time with him in Syria. The source says he was one of a group from London <a href=""http://www.channel4.com/news/syria-war-rebels-jihadi-ibrahim-al-mazwagi"">including Ibrahim al-Mazwagi</a>, the first British jihadi known to have died in Syria.</p>
<p>Emwazi initially joined the Migrants Brigade or Mujahideen in 2012. That year he was based in Idlib Province and then outside Aleppo. He then went on to join Al-Nusra and finally ISIS.</p>
<p>The source described him as personable, humorous on occasion but also determined that the fighters were portrayed by the media as people to be afraid of.</p>
<p>The source said he was a keen video games player, and a martial arts practitioner.</p>
<p>The source also recounted an occasion when as one of the best Arabic speakers in the foreign brigade he led the interrogation of a man who was questioned and then badly beaten.</p>
<p>&#x2018;Jihadi John&#x2019; has appeared in a series of videos in which hostages, including British aid worker Alan Henning, were brutally murdered.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I have no doubt that Mohammed is <a href=""http://www.channel4.com/news/search/?coreSiteName=news&amp;freetext=Jihadi+John"">Jihadi John</a>,&#x201D; said one of his close friends who identified him in an interview with The Washington Post. &#x201C;He was like a brother to me&#x2026; I am sure it is him.&#x201D;</p>
<h2>Cage report<br>
</h2>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Asim Qureshi, research director at the rights group, Cage, said after watching one of the videos: &#x201C;There was an extremely strong resemblance. This is making me feel fairly certain that this is the same person.&#x201D;</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">He later clarified that, due to the hood worn in all the videos, there was no way he could be 100 per cent certain.</p>
<p>Scotland Yard has refused to confirm the reports.</p>
<p>Commander Richard Walton, head of the Met&#x2019;s Counter Terrorism Command, said: &#x201C;We have previously asked media outlets not to speculate about the details of our investigation on the basis that life is at risk.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter-terrorism investigation.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Emwazi <a href=""http://www.channel4.com/news/jihadi-john-mohammed-emwazi-security-service-the-background"">is understood to have arrived in Britain as a young boy, aged six, after being born in Kuwait</a>. Growing up in west London, he was described as a &#x201C;polite, mild-mannered&#x201D; man with a penchant for wearing stylish clothes.</p>
<p>It was during a trip to Tanzania in August 2009 that Emwazi&#x2019;s life direction is thought to have started to change. Once landing in Dar es Salaam on the supposed Safari trip with two friends, he alleged he was detained by gun-wielding Tanzanian police and held overnight.</p>
<p>The trio were eventually refused entry to Tanzania and deported to the Netherlands, where they said they were questioned by MI5 agents who accused them of having links to Islamic extremists.</p>
<h2>MI5 terror watch list<br>
</h2>
<p>An article in <a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/british-muslims-on-safari-stopped-by-mi5-1959610.html"">The Independent</a> in May 2010 outlines the allegations. Upon returning to the UK, Emwazi was reportedly on the radar of MI5, who warned him that he was on a terror watch list which prevented him travelling to any Muslim country.</p>
<p>He is later understood to have filed a complaint with the Independent Police Complaints Commission over his treatment.</p>
<p>Emwazi later moved to Kuwait, where he got a job at a computer company. But on a visit to London in June 2010, it is understood he was detained once again by counter-terrorism officials and prevented from flying back.</p>
<p>Two years later he was apparently in Syria fighting alongside IS.</p>
<h2>Beheadings<br>
</h2>
<p>His first public appearance was last August in a video of the murder of American journalist <a href=""http://www.channel4.com/news/islamic-state-james-foley-beheading-video-syria-america"">James Foley last August</a>, dressed in black with only his eyes visible.</p>
<p>He later reappeared in videos of the beheadings of US journalist <a href=""http://www.channel4.com/news/is-video-shows-beheading-of-steven-sotloff"">Steven Sotloff</a>, British aid worker <a href=""http://www.channel4.com/news/is-victims-brother-he-tried-to-be-a-better-man"">David Haines</a>, American aid worker <a href=""http://www.channel4.com/news/islamic-state-militants-murder-us-aid-worker-kassig"">Peter Kassig</a> and British charity worker <a href=""http://www.channel4.com/news/muslim-leaders-condemn-islamic-states-alan-henning-threats"">Alan Henning</a>.</p>
<p>British and US security services have previously inferred that they knew his identity, but Thursday morning&#x2019;s developments and naming appear to have taken authorities by surprise.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Foreign Office has said: &#x201C;There is an ongoing police investigation into the murder of hostages by so-called ISIL in Syria. We are not going to give a running commentary on any element of a live operational security investigation.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The <a href=""http://www.westminster.ac.uk/"">University of Westminster</a> has also released a statement in which a spokesman has said: &#x201C;A Mohammed Emwazi left the university six years ago. If these allegations are true, we are shocked and sickened by the news. Our thoughts are with the victims and their families. We have students from 150 countries and their safety is of paramount concern. With other universities in London, we are working to implement the Government&#x2019;s Prevent strategy to tackle extremism.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The university later tweeted that it was <a href=""https://twitter.com/UniWestminster/status/570951774300991488"">postponing a student union event</a> called &#x2018;who is Muhammad?&#x2019;</p> </div>",www.channel4.com,,1005

The university confirmed that a student of that name graduated in 2009.</p> <p>&quot;If these allegations are true, we are shocked and sickened by the news,&quot; the university said in a statement.</p> <section class=""mod-25""> </section> <p>Emwazi is also thought to have traveled to Syria sometime in or around 2012.&#xA0;</p> <p><a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-31637090"">The BBC</a> reported that British intelligence had previously identified the man, but had chosen not to disclose his name for operational reasons.</p> <p>Commander Richard Walton of the London Metropolitan Police&apos;s Counter Terrorism Command released a statement saying, &quot;We have previously asked media outlets not to speculate about the details of our investigation on the basis that life is at risk. We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter-terrorism investigation.&quot;</p> <p>London-based CAGE, which works with Muslims in conflict with British intelligence services, said Thursday its research director, Asim Qureshi, saw strong similarities between Emwazi and &quot;Jihadi John,&quot; but because of the hood worn by the militant, &quot;there was no way he could be 100 percent certain.&quot;</p> <p>The Center for the Study of Radicalization and Political Violence at King&apos;s College London, which closely tracks fighters in Syria, also said it believed the identification was correct.</p> <p>The masked and hooded terrorist achieved instant notoriety when he appeared in a video released by ISIS last August that showed the beheading of American journalist James Foley. At the time, many commentators and analysts remarked on the man&apos;s distinct London accent.&#xA0;</p> <p>The man is believed to have appeared in other videos that showed the beheading of other hostages, including American journalist Steven Sotloff, British aid worker David Haines, British taxi driver Alan Henning, and American aid worker Peter Kassig, known as Abdul-Rahman after his apparent conversion to Islam in captivity.&#xA0;</p> <p>The man&apos;s most recent appearance came last month in a video with Japanese hostages Kenji Goto and Haruna Yukawa. Both men also were killed by the terror group.</p> <p>The terrorist was given the nickname &quot;Jihadi John&quot; after interviews with former ISIS hostages revealed him to be part of a group of British jihadists who guarded the hostages and were dubbed &quot;The Beatles.&quot;</p> <p>The BBC reported that Emwazi is believed to be an associate of a known terror suspect who traveled to Somalia in 2006, and is allegedly linked to a funding network for the Somali-based militant group Al Shabaab.</p> <p>CAGE said it has been in contact with Emwazi for more than two years after he accused British intelligence services of harassing him. It said that in 2010 he alleged British spies were preventing him from traveling to the country of his birth, Kuwait, where he planned to marry.</p> <p>No one answered the door at the brick row house in west London where the Emwazi family is alleged to have lived. Neighbors in the surrounding area of public housing projects either declined comment or said they didn&apos;t know the family.</p> <p>Neighbor Janine Kintenda, 47, who said she&apos;d lived in the area for 16 years, was shocked at the news.</p> <p>&quot;Oh my God,&quot; she told The Associated Press, lifting her hand to her mouth. &quot;This is bad. This is bad.&quot;</p> <p>Shiraz Maher of the King&apos;s College radicalization center said he was investigating whether Emwazi was among a group of young West Londoners who traveled to Syria in about 2012.</p> <p>Many of them are now dead, including Mohammad el-Araj, Ibrahim al-Mazwagi and Choukri Ellekhlifi, all killed in 2013.</p> <p>He said Emwazi&apos;s background was similar to that of other British jihadis, and disproved the idea &quot;that these guys are all impoverished, that they&apos;re coming from deprived backgrounds.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;They are by and large upwardly mobile people, well educated,&quot; he said.</p> <p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i></p> </div>",www.foxnews.com,,723

The latter includes a wide variety of funding schemes, including through medical facilities, oil and human trafficking mafias. According to sources in Mosul, the money supplied internally is allocated to local and foreign fighters, to encourage them to join up and continue fighting.&#xA0;IS took control of Mosul in June&#xA0;and then expanded in August to control large swaths of the country.</p> <p>Residents of Mosul say that the sale of oil extracted from wells controlled by the organization in both Iraq and Syria has provided a <a href=""http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/ar/politics/2014/08/iraq-syria-oil-smuggling-islamic-state-turkey.html"">sustained source of funding</a>. The organization also opened trade canals through Kurdish [territories in] Iraq and Turkey, with the help of Kurdish, Turkish and Iranian traders.</p> <p>In addition to oil sales, a secondary source of funding stems from the imposition of royalties on residents in IS territories. Members of the organization collect 50,000 dinars [$41.60] from each family as service and protection fees. The amount doubles for families whose sons did not join IS. One of the prominent tribal figures in Nineveh province, Sheikh Mohammad Abu Thayyab, said, &#x201C;The IS gangs imposed 50,000 dinars worth of royalties on every family if one of their sons did not join these terrorists.&#x201D;</p> <p>Sources in the city say that oil prices have skyrocketed. The price of gas tanks used for cooking has reached 75,000 dinars, [about $62] while coal oil is sold at 5,000 dinars a liter [$4.16]. Meanwhile, the price&#xA0;of food has quadrupled.</p> <p>The third funding source was exposed by otolaryngologist Siruwan al-Mosuli. He said that lately he noticed unusual movement within medical facilities in Mosul. Arab and foreign surgeons were hired, but prohibited from mixing with local doctors. Information then leaked about organ selling. Surgeries take place within a hospital and organs are quickly transported through networks specialized in trafficking human organs. Mosuli said that the organs come from fallen fighters who were quickly transported to the hospital, injured people who were abandoned or individuals who were&#xA0;kidnapped.</p> <p>He said that&#xA0;organ sales&#xA0;yield&#xA0;large profits. A specialized mafia is engaged in these operations, in addition to medical institutions working in other countries. Without coordination among these parties, such a trade cannot be sustained, he said. According to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the organization sells bodies and organs of injured people they arrest.</p> <p>The fourth source of funding is transforming the city of Nineveh, adjacent to Turkish borders, into a new center for <a href=""http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/tr/originals/2013/06/drug-use-spread-iraq-youth.html"">drug trafficking</a>. The Russian Federal Drug Control Service said IS was gaining significant revenues by smuggling and marketing Afghan heroin, which is sent from Iraq to Europe.</p> <p>&#x201C;The large-scale movement of Afghan heroin acts as an ongoing financial base, aiding the functioning of the Islamic State, which secures huge profits by providing half of the total heroin supplied to Europe via destabilized Iraq and some African countries,&#x201D; the Russian body said in a statement.</p> <p>For its part, the Times of London exposed a <a href=""http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/security/2014/09/is-women-prisons-mosul.html"">human trafficking network</a> established by IS in Mosul, where women and children were sold for money. This also constitutes a funding source for the fighters. According to the newspaper, women and children of Yazidi, Christian and other minority backgrounds are also sold through a networking hub in Syria&#x2019;s Raqqa.</p> <p>A report by OHCHR confirmed that more than 25,000 women and children have been imprisoned, sexually violated&#xA0;and sold by IS.</p> <p>The sixth funding source is human smuggling rings, especially for families who wish to emigrate to other countries. One family reached Turkey after reportedly paying $8,000 for each individual that escaped.</p> <p>Livestock seized by IS during the occupation of Yazidi, Turkmen and Shiite villages has also been smuggled. According to Ali Abdel Razzak, the majority of the residents in these villages worked in large-scale livestock ranching. So far it has not been established how much IS members seized as spoils of war when the villagers fled.</p> <p>When it comes to foreign funding, the organization has developed schemes that are difficult to uncover, despite intensive local and international monitoring. One such method, however, uses established trading routes. The organization has networks tasked with collecting donations from wealthy individuals under the pretext of supporting jihad. According to some sources in the trading industry, products are sold in the markets in IS at lower prices than within the countries of origin, a discrepancy that points toward&#xA0;money laundering.</p> <p class=""noScreen""> Read More: http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/security/2014/12/islamic-state-financing-funding-human-trafficking-extortion.html</p> </div>",www.al-monitor.com,,783

Security Council on Tuesday to look at allegations that the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) is using organ harvesting as a way to finance its operations.</p>
<p>Ambassador Mohamed Alhakim told reporters that in the past few weeks, bodies with surgical incisions and missing kidneys or other body parts have been found in shallow mass graves.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We have bodies. Come and examine them,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;It is clear they are missing certain parts.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He also said a dozen doctors have been &#x201C;executed&#x201D; in Mosul for refusing to participate in organ harvesting.</p>
<p>Alhakim briefed the council on the overall situation in Iraq and accused ISIS of &#x201C;crimes of genocide&#x201D; in targeting certain ethnic groups.</p>
<p>The outgoing U.N. envoy to Iraq, Nikolay Mladenov, told the council that 790 people were killed in January alone by terrorism and armed conflict.</p>
<p>Mladenov noted the increasing number of reports and allegations that ISIS is using organ harvesting as a financing method, but he said only that &#x201C;it&#x2019;s very clear that the tactics ISIL is using expand by the day.&#x201D; He used an alternative acronym for the group.</p>
<p>He said Iraq&#x2019;s most pressing goal is to win back the vast territory that ISIS has seized in the past year. The Sunni militants seized a third of both Iraq and neighboring Syria and imposed strict Sharia law.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Especially worrying is the increasing number of reports of revenge attacks committed particularly against members of the Sunni community in areas liberated from ISIL control,&#x201D; Mladenov said.</p>
<p>Sheikh Ahmed Aburisha is a tribal leader from Anbar province in Iraq, 85 percent of which is under ISIS control. In late January, he visited Washington to urge the U.S. to give his tribes weapons and money so they can defeat ISIS in Anbar.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Vice President Biden and Gen. [John] Allen have a clear picture of what is happening in Iraq and Anbar and what type of support is needed for the fighters in Anbar,&#x201D; Aburisha told CBS News&#x2019; Jennifer Janisch. &#x201C;We have received promises and we hope that these promises will materialize in reality on the ground.&#x201D;</p>

Ambassador Mohamed Alhakim called for a Security Council investigation into alleged mass graves full of bodies with surgical scars and missing kidneys. </p><p>According to Alkalim, a dozen doctors have been killed in Mosul because they wouldn&apos;t take part in the Islamic State&apos;s organ trafficking scheme. </p><p>Unconfirmed rumors of ISIS removing and selling organs have been around since at least December, when Middle East news outlet Al-Monitor <a href=""http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/security/2014/12/islamic-state-financing-funding-human-trafficking-extortion.html#"">published an article with more detailed claims</a> than Alkalim made this week. </p><p>Based on a report from one doctor in Mosul, Al-Monitor wrote: </p><blockquote><p>Surgeries take place within a hospital and organs are quickly transported through networks specialized in trafficking human organs ... the organs come from fallen fighters who were quickly transported to the hospital, injured people who were abandoned or individuals who were kidnapped.</p><p>He said that organ sales yield large profits. A specialized mafia is engaged in these operations, in addition to medical institutions working in other countries. Without coordination among these parties, such a trade cannot be sustained, he said.</p></blockquote><p>The Al-Monitor story also claims that the U.N.&apos;s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights confirmed &quot;the organization sells bodies and organs of injured people they arrest,&quot; a claim that was widely repeated by news sites in December, but seems to be based entirely on this single source.

                    <p> ISIS claimed Friday that a 26-year-old female American hostage was killed in an airstrike in Syria, according to NBC News partners Flashpoint Intelligence. </p>
                
                
                
                
              
              
                    <p> Defense officials told NBC News that U.S. military and military intelligence have no information to confirm ISIS&#x2019; claim, and the State Department said it could not confirm reports of the death &#x201C;in any way.&#x201D; </p>
                
                
                
                
              
              
                    <p> &quot;We are obviously deeply concerned by these reports. We have not at this time seen any evidence that corroborates ISIL&apos;s claim,&quot; said Bernadette Meehan, spokeswoman for the National Security Council said. </p>
                
                
                
                
              
              
                    <p> Kayla Mueller, originally from Arizona, was taken hostage by ISIS in Syria on Aug. 4, 2013, while leaving a Spanish Doctors Without Borders hospital. Her family previously had requested Mueller&apos;s name not be made public for fear it would endanger her life. </p>
                
                
                
                
              
              
                    <p> According to a statement released by a representative of her family on Friday urging caution in reporting on Mueller&apos;s situation, &quot;the common thread of Kayla&#x2019;s life has been her quiet leadership and strong desire to serve others.&quot; </p>
                
                
                
                
              
              
                    <p> &quot;Kayla has devoted her career to helping those in need in countries around the world,&quot; the statement added. </p>
                
                
                
                
              
              
                    <p> In a report distributed on Twitter, ISIS stated that Mueller was buried in the rubble of a building hit by Jordanian aircraft. Jordanian warplanes have pounded ISIS targets in Syria since the militants released a video that appeared to show a captured Jordanian fighter pilot being burned alive in a cage. It was impossible to confirm if any of the airstrikes had hit the building pictured in the ISIS report, and Jordan disputed the ISIS claim. </p>
                
                
                
                
              
              
                    <p> &#x201C;ISIS is being illogical and they&#x2019;re lying,&#x201D; Mohammad Al Moumani, a spokesman for the information ministry, told NBC News. &#x201C;How do they know it&#x2019;s a Jordanian aircraft? What was a woman doing in their training center or weapons storage facility? Because those are what we&#x2019;re targeting.&#x201D; </p>
                
                
                
                
              
              
                
                    
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
              
              
                    <p> State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said: &quot;I cannot confirm those reports in any way. Obviously people are looking into them, but cannot confirm them.&quot; When asked if she knew if the hostage was alive, Harf said: &quot;We&apos;re just not going to get into specifics about Americans being held overseas.&quot; </p>
                
                
                
                
              
              
                    <p> One senior defense official told NBC News &#x201C;the entire intel community&#x201D; in the U.S. government &#x201C;lit up immediately at the ISIS claim and is attempting to gather the facts.&#x201D; The official also said that if, in fact, the American woman has been killed it could be impossible to verify if was the result of an airstrike. </p>
                
                
                
                
              
              
                    <p> Mueller was among the U.S. hostages Army Delta Force commandos attempted to rescue in an early July operation in the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa. U.S. officials said at the time that several ISIS fighters were killed in a gunbattle but <a href=""http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/james-foley/isis-fighters-killed-james-foley-rescue-attempt-u-s-officials-n186411"">the hostages were nowhere to be found &#x2014; the commandoes had just missed them</a>. </p>
                
                
                
                
              
              
                    <p> She is believed to be the last U.S. hostage held captive by ISIS. Three others &#x2014; James Foley, Steven Sotloff and Abdul-Rahman Kassig &#x2014; were beheaded by ISIS militants. Recently, President Barack Obama said the U.S. is deploying &#x201C;all assets&#x201D; to save the young aid worker. </p>

                    <p> Mueller&apos;s family previously had requested that her name not be made public, and little has been publicized about her ordeal. </p>
                
                
                
                
              
              
                    <p> Her interest in activism started young: she was recognized as a National Young Leader while in high school at Tri City College Prep in Prescott, Arizona, and won several volunteering awards. As a teen, she volunteered for the Save Darfur Coalition, writing letters and placing calls to members of Congress, <a href=""http://bit.ly/1zFXDWa"">according to her local paper</a>. Mueller continued to protest the genocide in Darfur while studying international affairs at Northern Arizona University, according to local newspaper articles. She was <a href=""http://jackcentral.com/news/2009/04/peaceful-darfur-protest-held-amidst-snowy-flagstaff-weather/"">president of the group Students Taking Action Now: Darfur</a> and penned articles about Darfur in the school paper, The Lumberjack. </p>
                
                
                
                
              
              
                    <p> After graduating from Northern Arizona University in 2009, Mueller worked with humanitarian aid organizations in India, Israel and Palestine, according to the statement issued on behalf of her family. It said she returned home to Arizona in 2011 and spent a year working at an HIV/AIDS clinic and a women&apos;s shelter before traveling to France to work as an au pair and study the French language. </p>
                
                
                
                
              
              
                    <p> Sometime that year, Mueller uploaded a video to YouTube expressing solidarity with the Syrian people. While she initially studied French with the intention of working in Africa, according to the family representatives, Mueller instead went to the Turkish-Syrian border to work with Syrian refugees in December 2012. </p>
                
                
                
                
              
              
                    <p> Mueller spoke of her experiences in Syria at her local Kiwanis club in May 2013, saying that she is often asked &#x2014; once people learn she is American &#x2014; &#x201C;where is the world&#x201D; by desperate refugees. </p>
                
                
                
                
              
              
                    <p> &#x201C;All I can do is cry with them, because I don&apos;t know,&quot; she said, <a href=""http://dcourier.com/main.asp?SectionID=1&amp;SubsectionID=1&amp;ArticleID=119744"">according to an article on the event in her local paper</a>. &quot;For as long as I live, I will not let this suffering be normal. (I will not let this be) something we just accept.&quot; </p>
                
                
                
                
              
              
                    <p> She worked in Turkey with the Danish Refugee Council and the &#x201C;Support to Life&#x201D; humanitarian aid organization to assist refugees. When Mueller was taken captive in Aleppo, Syria, on Aug. 4, 2013, she was leaving a Doctors Without Borders hospital. </p>

For nearly 17 months, while her fellow American captives were beheaded one after another in serial executions posted on YouTube, Kayla Mueller&#x2019;s name remained a closely guarded secret, whispered among reporters, government officials and hostage negotiators &#x2014; all fearing that any public mention might imperil her life.</p><p class=""story-body-text story-content"">On Friday, the Islamic State confirmed her identity, announcing that Ms. Mueller, a 26-year-old aid worker from Prescott, Ariz., had been killed in the falling rubble of a building in northern <a href=""http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/syria/index.html?inline=nyt-geo"" class=""meta-loc"">Syria</a> that it said had been struck by bombs from a Jordanian warplane. Both the Jordanian and American governments said there was no proof, even as they rushed to deplore her possible death. Top Jordanian officials said the announcement was cynical propaganda.</p><p class=""story-body-text story-content"">But the group&#x2019;s use of Ms. Mueller&#x2019;s name for the first time prompted her family and its advisers to confirm her prolonged captivity in a statement and changed the calculus about what could be reported about her life. It threw a spotlight on a hostage ordeal that befell an eager and deeply idealistic young woman, who had ventured into one of the most dangerous parts of Syria &#x2014; apparently without the backing of an aid organization, according to interviews with advisers to the family and employees of Doctors Without Borders, the international medical charity that hosted Ms. Mueller during her brief stay in one of Syria&#x2019;s ravaged cities.</p><p class=""story-body-text story-content"">Initially based in southern Turkey, where she had worked for at least two aid organizations assisting Syrian refugees, Ms. Mueller appears to have driven into the northern Syrian city of Aleppo on Aug. 3, 2013, alongside a man who has been alternatively described as her Syrian friend or colleague, and by others as either her boyfriend or her fianc&#xE9;. He had been invited to travel to the city to help fix the Internet connection for a compound run by the Spanish chapter of Doctors Without Borders, known in Spanish as M&#xE9;dicos Sin Fronteras, or M.S.F. Employees of the charity said they were surprised when the young Syrian man arrived with Ms. Mueller.</p>

<p class=""story-body-text story-content"">It took longer than expected to finish the repair work, and as night approached, M.S.F. agreed to let the two stay overnight, out of concern for their safety, said Mr. Shenk. The next day the charity arranged to transport them to an Aleppo bus stop, where they planned to catch a bus back to Turkey.</p><p class=""story-body-text story-content"">They never made it. They were abducted on the road, the statement said.</p><p class=""story-body-text story-content"">Although Ms. Mueller had moved to Turkey in December 2012 to work with two organizations helping refugees &#x2014; including the Danish Refugee Council &#x2014; she was not employed by either of those groups when she entered Syria at a time when numerous foreigners already had been kidnapped inside the country, said the Mueller family advisers. What she was doing in Aleppo &#x2014; beyond accompanying her Syrian companion &#x2014; remains unclear.</p>
<p class=""story-body-text story-content"" id=""story-continues-3"">Her companion, who was released after several months, declined to be interviewed.</p><p class=""story-body-text story-content"">&#x201C;There is a lot of murkiness about what she was doing there. That&#x2019;s been the problem &#x2014; no one really knows,&#x201D; said one adviser of the Muellers.</p><p class=""story-body-text story-content"">In the statement released Friday, the family said that it had received the first message from Ms. Mueller&#x2019;s captors in May 2014 &#x2014; nine months after her disappearance. The Islamic State, also known as <a href=""http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/a/al_qaeda_in_mesopotamia/index.html?inline=nyt-org"" class=""meta-org"">ISIS</a> or ISIL, provided initial proof that she was alive, the family said.</p><p class=""story-body-text story-content"">Then on July 12, 2014, the Islamic State announced that it would kill her within 30 days unless the family provided a ransom of 5 million euros ($5.6 million), or exchanged her for Dr. Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani scientist educated in America who was convicted of trying to kill American soldiers and F.B.I. agents in Afghanistan in 2008. She is serving a sentence in a Texas jail, according to an email explaining the demands forwarded to The New York Times by an acquaintance of the Muellers. When the deadline passed, nothing happened, prompting the family to hope that Ms. Mueller might be spared.</p><p class=""story-body-text story-content"">During those 30 days, her parents shared their ordeal only with the tight-knit group of advisers and with parents of other American hostages held by the Islamic State. Together the anxious parents traveled to Washington to meet Obama administration officials to push for the release of their children. That was shortly before the United States began airstrikes against the Islamic State in concert with European and Arab allies. Soon after, in August, the Islamic State posted the first of its decapitation videos, starting with the beheading of the American James Foley, and then in quick succession the fellow Americans Steven J. Sotloff and Peter Kassig.</p><p class=""story-body-text story-content"">A group of concerned advisers helping the Muellers dispatched negotiators to Turkey, Qatar, Lebanon and Iraq in an effort to find a way to contact the Islamic State to negotiate Ms. Mueller&#x2019;s release. They spent many hours parsing messages by the Islamic State, trying to answer the crucial question: Would the group, which had shown no qualms about killing American male hostages, go so far as to behead a 26-year-old woman?</p><p class=""story-body-text story-content"">They feared the worst after the Islamic State released a video on Tuesday showing the immolation of a captured Jordanian pilot, a killing that shocked the world and particularly infuriated <a href=""http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/jordan/index.html?inline=nyt-geo"" class=""meta-loc"">Jordan</a>. In retaliation, the Jordanians then executed two prisoners convicted of terrorism, including a Qaeda-linked woman who had tried to blow up a hotel in Amman.</p> 
<p class=""story-body-text story-content"">The Jordanians then began their own extensive bombings of Islamic State targets in Syria.</p><p class=""story-body-text story-content"">It was one of those attacks, the Islamic State said in its message Friday, that killed Ms. Mueller.</p><p class=""story-body-text story-content"">Experts on the Middle East said they believed Ms. Mueller was dead, since the Islamic State had no motivation to make such an assertion about a hostage if it were not true. Some also speculated that the Islamic State might have killed her beforehand and taken the opportunity to blame the Jordanian bombs in her death.</p>

<p class=""story-body-text story-content"">Andrew J. Tabler, senior fellow at the Program on Arab Politics at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said it was possible the militants &#x201C;simply wanted to drive a wedge between regional and Western members of the coalition.&#x201D;</p>
<p class=""story-body-text story-content"" id=""story-continues-4"">Ms. Mueller, who was born in 1988, had a deep desire to help those less fortunate.

In 2012, she was drawn to what would soon become the world&#x2019;s top humanitarian crisis, the Syrian civil war. She moved to Turkey, where many Syrians were seeking refuge, and she settled in a border town assisting Syrian families for the Danish Refugee Council and an aid group called Support to Life. &#x201C;The common thread of Kayla&#x2019;s life has been her quiet leadership and strong desire to serve others,&#x201D; her family said in the statement.</p><p class=""story-body-text story-content"">The family advisers said there was not any indication that she had been working with an aid group when she went to Aleppo.

<p>
The parents of an American woman held hostage by ISIS revealed they had privately communicated with the terror group before it claimed she was killed a recent Jordanian airstrike.
</p><p>
A statement that circulated Twitter on Friday said an airstrike outside Raqqa, Syria, killed Kayla Mueller. The statement used her full name, which had not been public.
</p><p>
The claim could not be immediately confirmed and ISIS did not provide photographic evidence of Mueller&#x2019;s death, as the group has in the past with other hostages and its own fighters.

<p>
In a statement released Friday night, Mueller&apos;s parents said, &quot;This leaves us concerned, yet, we are still hopeful that Kayla is alive.&quot;
</p><p>
Addressing Kayla&apos;s captors directly, Carl and Marsha Mueller also requested that the terror group respond to their private communications.
</p><p>
&quot;Kayla&apos;s mother and I have been doing everything we can to get her released safely. At this time we ask you, who are holding Kayla, to contact us privately,&quot; the statement said.
</p><p>
A spokesperson for the White House <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/national-security-council.htm"" id=""ramplink_National Security Council_"">National Security Council</a> said they have &#x201C;not at this time seen any evidence that corroborates ISIL&#x2019;s claim,&#x201D; using an alternate acronym for the terror group.
</p><p>
A Jordanian official told ABC News ISIS&apos;s claim was &quot;illogical&quot; and was part of the terror group&apos;s public relations campaign. &quot;We need to be very careful not to fall in their trap,&quot; the official said.
</p><p>
Jordan&apos;s Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh, called ISIS&apos;s claim &quot;an old and sick trick.&quot;
</p><p>
&quot;So they behead innocent #US #UK &amp; Japan hostages &amp; BURN a brave #jordan pilot ALIVE &amp; now a hostage is killed by an airstrike? Sure! Sick!&quot; Judeh said on Twitter, referring to previous atrocities apparently committed on camera by ISIS fighters.
</p><p>
The ISIS statement appeared to contain some discrepancies, including Thursday&#x2019;s date on accompanying pictures purportedly showing the building that was struck, while the statement claimed the strikes occurred during Friday prayers. ISIS also claimed Mueller, 26, was the only person killed in that particular airstrike, with none of its fighters injured or killed.

<p>
Officials believe ISIS has misled the public before about the fate of hostages. The Jordanian government said ISIS killed a Jordanian pilot the terror group was holding a month ago, even though the terror group pretended he was alive during hostages negotiations last week.
</p><p>
In August, ABC News reported ISIS had <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/isis-demands-66m-ransom-26-year-american-woman/story?id=25127682"">demanded $6.6 million</a> for Mueller&apos;s release.
</p><p>
&#x201C;We are pouring through information right now,&#x201D; one U.S. official said, &#x201C;but there is no hard evidence&#x201D; that Mueller has been killed. Another official said that U.S. intelligence had reason to believe Mueller was alive as of a few weeks ago.
</p><p>
Mueller, from Prescott, Ariz., was kidnapped Aug. 4, 2013 after leaving a Spanish Doctors Without Borders hospital in Aleppo, Syria, according to information provided by a family spokesperson.
</p><p>
She had graduated from Northern Arizona University in 2009 and &#x201C;has devoted her career to helping those in need in countries around the world,&#x201D; the family spokesperson said.
</p><p>
&quot;Kayla has devoted her life to serving others,&quot; Arizona Governor Doug Ducey&apos;s said in a statement released Friday night. &quot;At just 26, she has literally been around the world, with the simple but righteous goal of making it a better place. As long as there are humanitarians like Kayla in this world, evil will not prevail,&quot; the statement said.
</p><p>
Mueller told her town&apos;s local newspaper, <a href=""http://dcourier.com/main.asp?SectionID=198&amp;SubSectionID=1&amp;ArticleID=119744"">The Daily Courier</a>, she felt called to help those suffering the most in the midst of the Syrian conflict.
</p><p>
&#x201C;For as long as I live, I will not let this suffering be normal,&#x201D; she said in the May 2013 report. &#x201C;[I will not let this be] something we just accept&#x2026; It&#x2019;s important to stop and realize what we have, why we have it and how privileged we are. And from that place, start caring and get a lot done.&#x201D;
</p><p>
In October 2011, Mueller uploaded a video to a Syrian activist YouTube channel in which she said, &#x201C;I am in solidarity with the Syrian people.&#x201D;

<p>Supporters of <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/isis"" class=""u-underline"">Islamic State</a> have claimed that an American aid worker held hostage by the militant group has been killed in a Jordanian air strike intended to avenge the burning to death of a captured Jordanian pilot.</p>
<p>A statement posted on a website sometimes used by Isis fighters and their supporters said that Kayla Mueller, 26, had been killed by a missile strike during <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/05/jordan-air-strikes-isis-pilot-murder"" class=""u-underline"">a bombing raid by Jordanian planes</a> on the Syrian city of Raqqa early on Friday.</p>
<p>Mueller was said to have been killed when rockets partially destroyed the building in which she was being held, the statement said, adding that no Isis fighters were killed in the attack.</p>
<p>Several pictures of a damaged building complex were included in the statement which they said showed the aftermath of the air strike, but the claim that Mueller had been killed could not be independently verified.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The criminal crusader coalition planes targeted sites outside Raqqa city today at noon while people were performing Friday prayers,&#x201D; the message read.<br></p>
<p>&#x201C;The raids continued on the same site for more than an hour. God has disappointed their endeavours and foiled their plot by not hitting any jihadi man thank God.&#x201D;</p>
<p>State Department deputy spokesperson Marie Harf said she could not confirm the report, but said that &#x201C;a number of Americans&#x201D; were being held by Isis.</p>
<p>Bernadette Meehan, a spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council, said: &#x201C;We are obviously deeply concerned by these reports.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;We have not at this time seen any evidence that corroborates Isil&#x2019;s claim,&#x201D; she said, using another acronym for the group.</p>
<p>Mueller&#x2019;s parents, Carl and Marsha Mueller from Arizona, said they were still hopeful she was alive.</p>
<p>In a statement released by a family representative, they asked Isis to contact the family privately. </p>
<p>&#x201C;You told us that you treated Kayla as your guest. As your guest her safety and wellbeing remains your responsibility,&#x201D; they said in a message directed to &#x201C;those in positions of responsibility for holding Kayla&#x201D;.</p>
<p>The Isis communique used Mueller&#x2019;s full name and included her US contact details, which had not been made public by the media at the family&#x2019;s request. </p>
<p>Last week the militant group prompted outrage around the world when they <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/03/isis-video-jordanian-hostage-burdning-death-muadh-al-kasabeh"" class=""u-underline"">released a video of Jordanian pilot Muadh al-Kasasbeh</a> being burned to death. </p>
<p>In response, Jordan&#x2019;s <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/king-abdullah"" class=""u-underline"">King Abdullah</a> vowed to step up his country&#x2019;s role in the US-led coalition against Isis,<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/04/isis-muadh-al-kasasbeh-death-jordan-revenge-mood"" class=""u-underline""> promising to wage &#x201C;relentless war&#x201D;</a> against the militant group which has taken control of a wide swath of Syria and Iraq.</p>
<p>Jordan announced that it sent tens of fighter jets to hit Isis targets in Syria on Thursday, including what they claimed were ammunition depots and training camps. Jordanian jets carried out a second wave of air strikes against Isis targets on Friday. US-led forces have launched 10 air strikes in <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria"" class=""u-underline"">Syria</a> since Thursday, according to the US military.</p>

<p>Jordanian officials seemed to cast doubt on the reports of Mueller&#x2019;s death. Foreign affairs minister Naser Judeh, <a href=""https://twitter.com/NasserJudeh/status/563763021168640000"" class=""u-underline"">said on Twitter</a>: &#x201C;An old and sick trick used by terrorists and despots for decades: claiming that hostages human shields held captive are killed by air raids.&#x201D;</p>
<p>When asked by CNN about reports Mueller had been killed, Jordan&#x2019;s government spokesman Mohammad al-Momani said Isis &#x201C;use and lie about facts&#x201D; in order to mislead public opinion. Momani said Jordan is &#x201C;suspicious&#x201D; of the claims.</p>
<p>Mueller, originally from Prescott, Arizona, was seized by Isis fighters in August 2013 as she left a hospital run by the Spanish branch of Medecins San Fronti&#xE8;res in Aleppo. </p>
<p>The aid worker had traveled to the Turkish-Syrian border in December 2012 to work with groups providing support to Syrian refugees, a family spokesperson said in a statement. </p>
<p>She had spent the previous four years working for various aid groups in northern India, Israel and the Palestinian territories.</p>
<p>An unaffiliated citizens group in Raqqa who have proved reliable in the past told the Guardian they believed the claims of Mueller&#x2019;s death were true, based on comments by Isis fighters. </p>
<p>But given the extent of the damage to the building complex shown in the statement, it is unclear how other Isis fighters could have escaped alive unless the hostage had been left unguarded.</p>
<p>Unusually for Isis, the militants did not provide footage or photographic evidence of Mueller&#x2019;s purported death as it has done with previous hostages.</p>
<p>Over the past seven months, Isis has killed three American hostages: journalists <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/19/james-wright-foley-beheaded-isis-video"" class=""u-underline"">James Foley</a> and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/02/isis-video-steven-sotloff-beheading"" class=""u-underline"">Steven Sotloff</a> and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/news/2014/dec/18/-sp-the-race-to-save-peter-kassig"" class=""u-underline"">aid worker Peter Kassig</a>. All three men were on camera, and video of their killings was posted online.</p>
<p>Two Japanese hostages, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/25/haruna-yukawa-execution-by-isis-confirmed"" class=""u-underline"">Haruna Yukawa</a> and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/31/isis-video-beheading-japanese-hostage-kenji-goto"" class=""u-underline"">Kenji Goto</a>, were killed in December, as were two British aid workers, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/13/briton-david-haines-portrait-father-man"" class=""u-underline"">David Haines </a>and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/14/alan-henning-isis-syria-hostage-aid-worker"" class=""u-underline"">Alan Henning</a>. </p>
<p>John Cantlie, a British journalist, is believed to still be in Isis captivity. Cantlie has appeared in several Isis propaganda videos, the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/03/john-cantlie-isis-eighth-video"" class=""u-underline"">last of which was disseminated online</a> in early January. <br></p>
<p>A second western female hostage is believed to remain in the hands of Isis militants in Syria. In contrast to the nine male hostages and Kasasbeh, neither Mueller nor the second female hostage have ever been shown on camera or in propaganda imagery distributed by the group.</p>
<p>Isis is believed to have previously released misleading reports on the fate of their captives. The group maintained that Kasasbeh was still alive throughout a prolonged &#x2013; and eventually fruitless &#x2013; attempt to negotiate a prisoner swap involving the two Japanese hostages and Sajida al-Rishawi, a would-be suicide bomber who had been on death row in Jordan since 2008. </p>

<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s part of their criminal propaganda. They have lied that our pilot is alive and tried to negotiate, claiming he is alive while they had killed him weeks before,&#x201D; al-Momani added.</p>

<p>Mueller, of Prescott, Arizona, had been working in Turkey assisting Syrian refugees, according to a 2013 article in The Daily Courier, her hometown newspaper. The 26-year-old told the paper that she was drawn to help with the situation in Syria.</p>
<p>&#x201C;For as long as I live, I will not let this suffering be normal,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s important to stop and realize what we have, why we have it and how privileged we are. And from that place, start caring and get a lot done.&#x201D;</p>
<p>According to the local paper, Mueller had been working with the humanitarian aid agency Support to Life, as well as a local NGO that helped female Syrian refugees develop skills.</p> <p>A 2007 article about Mueller from the same local newspaper said she was a student at Northern Arizona University and was active in the Save Darfur Coalition.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Obama said the U.S. was &#x201C;deploying all the assets that we can&#x201D; to find Mueller.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We are in very close contact with the family trying to keep them updated,&#x201D; he said in an interview with NBC&#x2019;s Today Show. &#x201C;Obviously this is something that is heart-breaking for the family and we want to make sure we do anything we can to make sure that any American citizen is rescued from this situation.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Mueller&#x2019;s identity had not been disclosed until now out of fears for her safety.</p>
<p>If her death is confirmed, she would be the fourth American to die while in the captivity of the Islamic State militants. Three other Americans, journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and aid worker Peter Kassig were beheaded by the group.</p>

<p>Jordan, which is part of a U.S.-led coalition bombing Islamic State group targets in Syria, stepped up its attacks after the Islamic State announced it had killed a captive Jordanian pilot. The Syrian government said Thursday that dozens of Jordanian fighter jets had bombed Islamic State training centres and weapons storage sites. It did not say where the attacks occurred.</p>
<p>The Jordanian military said that Jordanian jetfighters carried out &#x201C;a series of attacks today and destroyed the targets and returned safely.&#x201D; It did not elaborate or give a location for the airstrikes.</p>
<p>But activists who monitor the Syrian conflict from inside the country said U.S.-led coalition planes hit several targets on the edges and outskirts of Raqqa, in quick succession on Friday.</p>

<p>A collective known as &#x201C;Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently&#x201D; said the planes targeted multiple Islamic State positions and headquarters in the western and eastern countryside of Raqqa, sending columns of smoke into the sky. Explosions could be heard in the city. The collective said there were no recorded civilian casualties, and did not mention Islamic State casualties.</p>
<p>The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said dozens of Islamic State members were killed in coalition airstrikes that targeted a tanks-and-vehicles depot in the area of al-Madajen and at least six other Islamic State positions, including a training camp and a prison.</p>

</p><p> Abu Obeida (or Ubaidah) al-Masri, secretary of the Zakat (charity) bureau and treasurer of IS Syrian branch, eloped with the funds amounting to &quot;billion Syrian pounds&quot; which have been collected by his department in Deir Ez Zour province,&#xA0;<a href=""http://www.almasryalyoum.com/news/details/648097"">Al-Masry Al-Youm newspaper reported</a>, citing Syrian Press Center news site.

<p>According to the<a href=""http://www.hidaya.org/publications/zakat-information/10-what-is-zakat-obligatory-charity""> Hidaya Foundation</a>, Zakat is an obligatory act that has to be performed by every adult and able-bodied Muslim. It is an important pillar among the five pillars of Islam. Zakat is a part of the wealth and property that Muslims must pay annually to help the poor of their community. One of the main purposes of Zakat is to keep those who are wealthy clean, monetarily, from sin. It is a form of Sadaqah (charity) which is obligatory for Muslims.</p>

<p>When the merchants told ISIS militants that they are already helping and supporting the poor families with money and aid, ISIS did not exempt them from paying the 2.5 percent.&#xA0;</p>

<p>&quot;The money paid to the poor without reference to the Zakat Chamber is an act of charity, but it doesn&apos;t exempt traders from paying to the Zakat Chamber,&quot; an ISIS source reportedly stated.</p>

<p>Jordanian officials have sworn vengeance against the Islamic State terrorist group for murdering al-Kasaesbeh. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden has also issued a statement condemning, &quot;in the strongest possible terms, the brutality and violence that ISIL has consistently shown to its captives and to the people of Iraq and Syria.&quot;&#xA0;</p>

<p>&#x201C;ISIL is trying to build this overarching caliphate through which there is no diversity of thought, of religion, values or culture,&#x201D; says Gianni Pittella, member of the European Parliament. &#x201C;The fact remains that ISIL is a very pernicious entity.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;I never intended to kill his penis. I was just angry and all I wanted was to make him feel the pain I was feeling,&#x201D; she told a Sapa correspondent.</p></div><div class=""articleBodyMore"" id=""article-more-body""><p>&#x201C;I heard about the video from one of my classmates and I thought that they were joking, but then I saw the video myself and lost my mind.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The girl, whose name is known to a Sapa correspondent but cannot be published because she is a minor, attacked Humphrey Khoza, 25, with battery acid while he was drinking beer with friends at a tavern in Cork village, near Hazyview, on January 17.</p>
<p>She said Khoza had tricked her because she was not aware he was not using a condom or that he was filming them.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I had to do something to show him that I was angry and wanted to hurt him so that he can see that he messed with the wrong girl,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p>She searched in her father&apos;s tools for a wheel spanner she could use to teach Khoza a lesson.</p>
<p>&#x201C;While I was searching I came across an old acid bottle. I took it and went straight to his regular drinking place and when I got there I became angrier. I didn&apos;t hesitate to pour the acid on him,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p>Khoza, who had no problem with his name being published, but asked not to be photographed, said he had been dating the girl since December.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Everything happened in a blink of an eye because I saw her when she was coming with a bottle, but I didn&apos;t realise that she was carrying acid. She just angrily called me a dog,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;She asked how in the world I could have done such an evil thing to her. It was only then that I realised that she was talking about the video that I took while we were having sex.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In the video, Khoza is seen pushing the girl, in her school uniform, onto a bed. He added that the sex was consensual.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We agreed to have sex, but she was not aware that I was filming the sex using my laptop computer. I did not intend to show anyone the video and I still don&apos;t know how it got onto social media,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>The remorseful Khoza added that although his penis would never work again due to the damage caused by the acid, he was lucky to be alive.</p>
<p>He said he was advised to press charges against the girl, but does not see the point.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Even if I press charges it is useless because it won&apos;t bring back my manhood. Her being in jail will just ruin her future because she is still young and I do not have the energy to attend courts,&#x201D; said Khoza.</p>
<p>He now has to urinate through a tube and has to undergo surgery.</p>
<p>The girl said she was also considering pressing charges relating to his creation of pornography.</p>
<p>According to the Film and Publications Act, child pornography is defined as &#x201C;any image or any description of a person, real or simulated, who is, or who is depicted or described as being, under the age of 18 years, engaged in sexual conduct&#x201D;.</p>
<p>When asked for comment Calcutta police said they would open a case if either of the two came forward.</p>

<p>The girl apparently cannot be named as she is under age. According to African Eye News Service (AENS), on January 17, after discovering a pornographic video of her and her boyfriend having sex had gone viral online, she went to a tavern in Cork village, close to Hazyview in Mpumalanga, South Africa where her boyfriend was drinking with friends.</p>

They report that she didn&#x2019;t appear to notice they were being filmed while having sex, but that it was consensual.</p>
<p>Khoza did say that he was lucky to be alive, despite the fact that his penis will never work again. He apparently now has to urinate through a tube and is facing further surgery.</p>

<p>man named Humphrey Khoza who was reportedly attacked with battery acid by his 17-year-old girlfriend on <nobr>17 January</nobr> 2015 while he was drinking beer with friends at a tavern in Cork village near Hazyview, Mpumalanga (a province in eastern South Africa). According to the report, the unnamed girlfriend was furious with Khoza for having secretly made and distributed a video of the two of them engaging in sex, so she poured acid onto his genitals as punishment, leaving Khoza with a &#x201C;penis would [that] never work again due to the damage caused by the acid,&#x201D; and having &#x201C;to urinate through a tube and undergo surgery.&#x201D;</p>
<p>A South African Press Association (SAPA) <a href=""http://www.timeslive.co.za/local/2015/02/03/i-never-intended-to-kill-his-penis-i-was-just-angry-mpumalanga-acid-attack-girl"">account</a> of the purported incident relayed the girl&#x2019;s self-described motivations for her actions:</p>
<p><div class=""quoteBlock""><br>
&#x201C;I never intended to kill his penis. I was just angry and all I wanted was to make him feel the pain I was feeling.&#x201D;</div></p>
<p>&#x201C;I heard about the video from one of my classmates and I thought that they were joking, but then I saw the video myself and lost my mind.&#x201D;</p>
<p>She said Khoza had tricked her because she was not aware he was not using a condom or that he was filming them.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I had to do something to show him that I was angry and wanted to hurt him so that he can see that he messed with the wrong girl,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p>She searched in her father&#x2019;s tools for a wheel spanner she could use to teach Khoza a lesson.</p>
<p>&#x201C;While I was searching I came across an old acid bottle. I took it and went straight to his regular drinking place and when I got there I became angrier. I didn&#x2019;t hesitate to pour the acid on him,&#x201D; she said.<br>
</p></div><br> <p>The AENS report quoted Khoza as maintaining he &#x201C;didn&#x2019;t know how [the sex tape] got onto social media&#x201D; and he did not intend to press charges against the girl:</p>
<p><div class=""quoteBlock""><br>
&#x201C;Everything happened in a blink of an eye because I saw her when she was coming with a bottle but I didn&#x2019;t realise that she was carrying acid. She just angrily called me a dog. She asked how in the world I could have done such an evil thing to her. It was only then that I realised that she was talking about the video that I took while we were having sex.</div></p>
<p>&#x201C;We agreed to have sex, but she was not aware that I was filming the sex using my laptop computer. I did not intend to show anyone the video and I still<br>
don&#x2019;t know how it got onto social media.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Even if I press charges it is useless because it won&#x2019;t bring back my manhood. Her being in jail will just ruin her future because she is still young and I do not have the energy to attend courts.&#x201D;<br>

<p>A woman in Henan province has been arrested for reportedly chopping off her husband&apos;s penis after discovering that he was having an affair&#x2014;then going to the hospital and cutting it off <em>again</em>. </p>

<p>The husband and father of five, 32-year-old Fan Lung, had used his wife&apos;s phone to send a steamy email to his mistress, 21-year-old Zhang Hung, from his home in the city of Shangqiu, <a href=""http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/jilted-wife-chopped-husbands-penis-4969780"">The Mirror</a> reports. </p>

<p>Fan had forgotten to log out of his account, and when his wife Feng, 30, looked through her phone, she found the message among several others that he&apos;d sent to to his <em>xiao san</em>. In a fit of rage, Feng grabbed a pair of scissors and chopped off her husband&apos;s penis while he was sleeping in their bedroom.</p>

<p>Fan was taken to a hospital, where doctors were able to reattach his precious manhood. Feng, however, managed to sneak into his hospital room and cut his penis off again before tossing it out of a window, The Mirror said. </p>

<p>&quot;The first [time] we were aware of what happened was when someone came into the reception area to say a naked man was beating up a woman outside the hospital,&quot; a hospital spokesperson was quoted as saying in the report.</p>

<p>&quot;Staff rushed out to see what was happening and found the patient with blood streaming down his legs hitting the woman.&quot; </p>

<p>They brought the fighting couple back into the hospital and discovered that Feng had cut off her husband&apos;s newly reattached member.</p>

<p>Doctors and police searched outside for the man&apos;s severed penis, but to no avail. They believe it was carried off by a stray animal. </p>

<p>Fan, who&apos;d lost a lot of blood at this point, is now in stable condition after undergoing emergency surgery but is &quot;extremely emotionally distraught,&quot; as one might expect. </p>

<p>Fan&apos;s side-lover, however, said she still plans to marry him. </p>

<p>&quot;It doesn&#x2019;t matter that he&#x2019;s lost his fertility, he has five children already,&quot; she was quoted as saying.</p>

                                <p>It&#x2019;s a well-known fact that a woman&#x2019;s jealousy is not something to be underestimated, and that applies all the more so to a scorned wife who has been cheated on by her husband.</p>
<p>In a bizarre, but true illustration of that edict, a jealous wife in China, 30-year-old Feng Lung, reported chopped her husband&#x2019;s penis off with a pair of sharp scissors, not once, but twice, in order to teach him a lesson for his infidelity.</p>
<p>Having found out her husband was cheating on her, the woman sliced off his penis, which was reattached successfully by surgeons in Shangqiu in central China&#x2019;s Henan province. When she saw her husband had sent a raunchy email to his mistress once again, she severed his member a second time.</p>
<p>Lung is now facing jail after being arrested for causing grievous bodily harm to her husband, 32-year-old, Fan Lung.</p>
<p><em>The Mirror</em> reports that <a href=""http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/jilted-wife-chopped-husbands-penis-4969780"">surgeons were able</a> to reattach the penis, but when the jealous wife found the email on her phone, she reportedly sneaked into his hospital room and cut it off again before throwing it out of a window.</p>
<p>The man ran outside the hospital to confront his wife and to find his <a href=""http://www.inquisitr.com/1727632/man-with-two-penises-pens-tell-all-book/"">severed penis</a>. He was seen naked and pouring with blood in the street outside the facility.</p>
<p>A hospital spokesman told reporters, &#x201C;The first we were aware of what happened was when someone came into the reception area to say a naked man was beating up a woman outside the hospital. Staff rushed out to see what was happening and found the patient with blood streaming down his legs hitting the woman. He was stopped and the woman was taken in for treatment, and then we discovered she had chopped his penis off again.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Despite an extensive search by police officers at the scene, <a href=""http://crimefeed.com/2015/01/man-beats-wife/"">the man&#x2019;s penis</a> was never located, and authorities believe it may have been eaten by a stray dog or cat.</p>
<p>The hospital spokesman added, &#x2018;The man had lost a lot of blood and was taken in for emergency surgery. He is now in a stable condition but is extremely emotionally distraught.&#x201D;</p>

				<p>A woman in China chopped off her husband&#x2019;s penis not once, but twice.   </p>
<p>After Feng Lung, 30, found out that Fan Lung, 32, was sending racy emails to another woman, she chopped it off, according to the <a href=""http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/jilted-wife-chopped-husbands-penis-4969780""><em>Mirror</em></a>.   </p>
<p>Lung had used Feng&#x2019;s cell phone to send his lover an email, according to the news outlet.   </p>
<p>After forgetting to log out of his account, she found the messages, and stormed into the bedroom where her husband was sleeping and allegedly cut off his penis with a pair of scissors.  </p>
<p>But the anger for her husband and the father of her five children didn&#x2019;t stop there.   </p>
<p>While he was recovering in the hospital, she allegedly snipped it off again after surgeons had reattached it.  </p>
<p>She then threw it out the window.   </p>
<p>Despite losing a lot of blood, Lung chased his wife outside.   </p>
<p>&#x201C;Staff rushed out to see what was happening and found the patient with blood streaming down his legs hitting the woman,&#x201D; a hospital spokesperson said according to the news outlet.  </p>
<p>Doctors and police officers failed to find his penis when they searched outside.  </p>
<p>Feng Lung is now under arrest for grievous bodily harm, the new outlet reports.  </p>
<p>But Fan Lung&#x2019;s lover isn&#x2019;t alarmed that Lung is missing his penis.  </p>
<p>&#x201C;It doesn&#x2019;t matter that he&#x2019;s lost his fertility, he has five children already,&#x201D; she said.</p>

						<p>Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.</p>
<p>A jealous wife in China chopped off her cheating husband&#x2019;s penis as he slept, then snuck into his hospital room after he had it sewn back on &#x2014;&#xA0;and hacked it off again and tossed it out the window.</p>
<p>Fan Lung, a dad of five, sealed his fate when he decided to use his wife&#x2019;s cellphone to send his secret lover a hot and heavy email, Central European News reports.</p>
<p>The 32-year-old forgot to log out of his account after the message was sent, which is how his 21-year-old wife, Feng &#x2014;&#xA0;who is now under arrest for grievous bodily harm &#x2014;&#xA0;came across the saucy exchange and snapped.</p>
<p>The jilted wife went berserk, grabbed a pair of scissors, stormed into their bedroom and cut off his penis while he was sleeping.</p>
<p>Lung was rushed to the hospital, where doctors were able to save the appendage and sew it back on.</p>
<p>But Feng was able to sneak into the recovery room, where she chopped his penis off a second time and threw it out the window, according to CEN.</p>
<p>A shocked Lung chased his wife outside, despite losing a lot of blood.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Staff rushed out to see what was happening and found the patient with blood streaming down his legs hitting the woman,&#x201D; a hospital spokesman said. &#x201C;He was stopped and the woman was taken in for treatment, and then we discovered she had chopped his penis off again.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Despite desperate search efforts, authorities were unable to find Lung&#x2019;s manhood. Police believe it may have been stumbled upon by a stray dog or cat, according to CEN.</p>
<p>Lung&#x2019;s side chick &#x2014;&#xA0;Zhang Hung, 21 &#x2014;&#xA0;said she&#x2019;s OK with her man not being able to have more children.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It doesn&#x2019;t matter that he&#x2019;s lost his fertility,&#x201D; she told CEN. &#x201C;He has five children already.&#x201D;</p>

The highway was closed for more than a hour.</p><p>By Tuesday evening, Leelah&apos;s story had become a worldwide story - one of how transgender teens often feel alone and afraid. The hashtag #LeelahAlcorn was topping Twitter; news sites worldwide had picked up the story; and someone had even created a Wikipedia page for Alcorn.</p><p>The State Highway Patrol continues to investigate; no charges have been filed. Her body was sent to the Montgomery County coroner for an autopsy, which will take several weeks.</p><p>Alcorn&apos;s family declined to comment to The Enquirer. In a statement via the Kings Local School District, the family requested privacy.</p><p>Alcorn&apos;s mother, Carla Wood Alcorn, wrote on Facebook Sunday, &quot;My sweet 16-year-old son, Joshua Ryan Alcorn, went home to Heaven this morning.

<p>Leelah Alcorn left a heartbreaking suicide note on her Tumblr blog before walking out onto a busy road.</p>
<p>The 17-year-old <a href=""http://www.pghlesbian.com/2014/12/17-year-old-ohio-trans-girl-dies-by-suicide/"">scheduled the post</a> to go live <a href=""http://lazerprincess.tumblr.com/post/106096940091/im-seeing-a-bunch-of-people-do-a-6-selfies-of"">on her blog</a> in advance before committing suicide on the I-71 highway in Ohio, USA.</p>
<p>The suicide note detailed her early problems with transgender dysphoria and the struggles of growing up in an oppressive household.</p>
<p>She accused her devout Christian parents of blocking her transition and refusing to acknowledge her true gender.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I was 16 I realized that my parents would never come around, and that I would have to wait until I was 18 to start any sort of transitioning treatment, which absolutely broke my heart. The longer you wait, the harder it is to transition. I felt hopeless, that I was just going to look like a man in drag for the rest of my life. On my 16th birthday, when I didn&#x2019;t receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a second post, also scheduled, Alcorn wrote: &quot;Mom and Dad: Fuck you. You can&#x2019;t just control other people like that. That&#x2019;s messed up.&quot;</p>
<p>Her mother Carla Alcorn <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2891267/Transgender-teenager-leaves-heartbreaking-suicide-note-blaming-Christian-parents-walking-tractor-trailer-highway.html"">posted a tribute</a> to her daughter on Facebook, but referred to her as &quot;son&quot; and used her birth name, making no mention of suicide.</p>
<p>At the end of her note, Leelah pleaded: &quot;My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year. I want someone to look at that number and say &apos;that&#x2019;s fucked up&apos; and fix it. Fix society. Please.&quot;</p>

The local news accounts refer to Alcorn as male, but she blogged frequently on a Tumblr called &quot;Lazer Princess&quot; about living as a trans teen. Judging by the Tumblr, she was a fan of <em>Sailor Moon</em>, feminism, and stockings with cats on them; she regularly re-blogged inspirational photos of trans adults. </p><p>It&apos;s also where she published a post<a href=""http://lazerprincess.tumblr.com/post/106447705738/suicide-note""> titled &quot;Suicide Note,&quot;</a> which she had pre-scheduled before her death. From the beginning of the note: </p><blockquote><p>If you are reading this, it means that I have committed suicide and obviously failed to delete this post from my queue.</p><p>Please don&apos;t be sad, it&apos;s for the better. The life I would&apos;ve lived isn&apos;t worth living in&#x2026; because I&apos;m transgender. I could go into detail explaining why I feel that way, but this note is probably going to be lengthy enough as it is. To put it simply, I feel like a girl trapped in a boy&apos;s body, and I&apos;ve felt that way ever since I was 4. I never knew there was a word for that feeling, nor was it possible for a boy to become a girl, so I never told anyone and I just continued to do traditionally &quot;boyish&quot; things to try to fit in.</p><p>When I was 14, I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness. After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was. I immediately told my mom, and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that it was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn&apos;t make mistakes, that I am wrong. If you are reading this, parents, <em>please</em> don&apos;t tell this to your kids. Even if you are Christian or are against transgender people don&apos;t ever say that to someone, especially your kid. That won&apos;t do anything but make them hate them self. That&apos;s exactly what it did to me.</p><p>My mom started taking me to a therapist, but would only take me to christian therapists, (who were all very biased) so I never actually got the therapy I needed to cure me of my depression. I only got more christians telling me that I was selfish and wrong and that I should look to God for help.</p><p>When I was 16 I realized that my parents would never come around, and that I would have to wait until I was 18 to start any sort of transitioning treatment, which absolutely broke my heart. The longer you wait, the harder it is to transition. I felt hopeless, that I was just going to look like a man in drag for the rest of my life. On my 16th birthday, when I didn&apos;t receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep.</p></blockquote><p>Alcorn apparently believed she&apos;d never be able to transition successfully. She concludes:</p><blockquote><p>After a summer of having almost no friends plus the weight of having to think about college, save money for moving out, keep my grades up, go to church each week and feel like shit because everyone there is against everything I live for, I have decided I&apos;ve had enough. I&apos;m never going to transition successfully, even when I move out. I&apos;m never going to be happy with the way I look or sound. I&apos;m never going to have enough friends to satisfy me. I&apos;m never going to have enough love to satisfy me. I&apos;m never going to find a man who loves me. I&apos;m never going to be happy. Either I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself. There&apos;s no winning. There&apos;s no way out. I&apos;m sad enough already, I don&apos;t need my life to get any worse. People say &quot;it gets better&quot; but that isn&apos;t true in my case. It gets worse. Each day I get worse.</p><p>That&apos;s the gist of it, that&apos;s why I feel like killing myself. Sorry if that&apos;s not a good enough reason for you, it&apos;s good enough for me. As for my will, I want 100% of the things that I legally own to be sold and the money (plus my money in the bank) to be given to trans civil rights movements and support groups, I don&apos;t give a shit which one. The only way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren&apos;t treated the way I was, they&apos;re treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights. Gender needs to be taught about in schools, the earlier the better. My death needs to mean something. My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year. I want someone to look at that number and say &quot;that&apos;s fucked up&quot; and fix it. Fix society. Please.</p></blockquote><p>On Facebook, Alcorn&apos;s mother has written, &quot;My sweet 16 year old son, Joshua Ryan Alcorn went home to heaven this morning.

<p>We&apos;re at a loss for words right now. Our hearts are completely broken by this news.</p>
<p>17-year-old transgender teen <strong>Leelah Alcorn</strong>, also known as Joshua Alcorn, was killed after being struck by a tractor-trailer on a highway in Ohio around 2:30 a.m.</p>
<p>The death, however, was NOT accidental.</p>
<p>Leelah took her own life and detailed exactly why she was killing herself in a lengthy and heart-shattering suicide note posted to her <strong>tumblr</strong> page.</p>
<p><a href=""http://perezhilton.com/2014-12-22-salvation-army-doesnt-welcome-lgbt-leadership-positions#.VKLHgAOCU""><strong>[ Related: Salvation Army Documents Show LGBTQ Discrimination ]</strong></a></p>
<p>After explaining to her followers why exactly they were seeing the note, she revealed she took her own life because<a id=""more-444617""></a> she was never accepted for being transgender.</p>
<p>Especially from her family.</p>
<p>Some of the more gut-wrenching parts of her note are as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&quot;When I was 14, I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness. After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was. I immediately told my mom, and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that it was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn&apos;t make mistakes, that I am wrong. <strong>If you are reading this, parents, <em>please</em> don&apos;t tell this to your kids. Even if you are Christian or are against transgender people don&apos;t ever say that to someone, especially your kid. That won&apos;t do anything but make them hate them self.</strong> That&apos;s exactly what it did to me&#x2026;.</p>
<p>When I was 16 I realized that my parents would never come around, and that I would have to wait until I was 18 to start any sort of transitioning treatment, which absolutely broke my heart. <strong>The longer you wait, the harder it is to transition.</strong> I felt hopeless, that I was just going to look like a man in drag for the rest of my life. On my 16th birthday, when I didn&apos;t receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep.</p>
<p>I formed a sort of a &quot;fuck you&quot; attitude towards my parents and came out as gay at school, thinking that maybe if I eased into coming out as trans it would be less of a shock. Although the reaction from my friends was positive, my parents were pissed. They felt like I was attacking their image, and that I was an embarrassment to them. <strong>They wanted me to be their perfect little straight christian boy, and that&apos;s obviously not what I wanted&#x2026;</strong></p>
<p>I have decided I&apos;ve had enough. I&apos;m never going to transition successfully, even when I move out. I&apos;m never going to be happy with the way I look or sound. I&apos;m never going to have enough friends to satisfy me. I&apos;m never going to have enough love to satisfy me. I&apos;m never going to find a man who loves me. I&apos;m never going to be happy. Either I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself. There&apos;s no winning&#x2026;</p>
<p>That&apos;s the gist of it, that&apos;s why I feel like killing myself. Sorry if that&apos;s not a good enough reason for you, it&apos;s good enough for me. <strong>As for my will, I want 100% of the things that I legally own to be sold and the money (plus my money in the bank) to be given to trans civil rights movements and support groups, I don&apos;t give a shit which one. </strong>The only way <em>I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren&apos;t treated the way I was, they&apos;re treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights.</em></p>
<p>Gender needs to be taught about in schools, the earlier the better. My death needs to mean something. My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year. I want someone to look at that number and say &quot;that&apos;s fucked up&quot; and fix it.<strong> Fix society. Please.</strong>&quot;</p></blockquote>

<p>Leelah Alcorn, born Joshua Ryan, left behind a harrowing note posted on Tumblr that exposed the pain, frustration and rejection Leelah felt, including her feeling that &#x201C;there&#x2019;s no way out,&#x201D; and her concern that she would never fully transition.</p>
<p>Leelah died around 2:20 a.m. Sunday after she was hit by a tractor trailer near the&#xA0; South Lebanon exit of I-71. While <a href=""http://www.newnownext.com/ohio-trans-teen-commits-suicide-leaves-heartbreaking-note-declaring-theres-no-way-out/12/2014/www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/warren-county/joshua-alcorn-kings-mill-teen-killed-on-i-71-remembered-as-sweet-talented"">initial news reports </a>seemed to suggest her death was an accident, her note made her intentions clear:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you are reading this, it means that I have committed suicide and obviously failed to delete this post from my queue.</p>
<p>Please don&#x2019;t be sad, it&#x2019;s for the better. The life I would&#x2019;ve lived isn&#x2019;t worth living in&#x2026; because I&#x2019;m transgender. I could go into detail explaining why I feel that way, but this note is probably going to be lengthy enough as it is. To put it simply, I feel like a girl trapped in a boy&#x2019;s body, and I&#x2019;ve felt that way ever since I was 4. I never knew there was a word for that feeling, nor was it possible for a boy to become a girl, so I never told anyone and I just continued to do traditionally &#x201C;boyish&#x201D; things to try to fit in.</p>
<p>When I was 14, I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness. After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was. I immediately told my mom, and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that it was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn&#x2019;t make mistakes, that I am wrong.

<p>My mom started taking me to a therapist, but would only take me to christian therapists, (who were all very biased) so I never actually got the therapy I needed to cure me of my depression. I only got more Christians telling me that I was selfish and wrong and that I should look to God for help.</p>
<p>When I was 16 I realized that my parents would never come around, and that I would have to wait until I was 18 to start any sort of transitioning treatment, which absolutely broke my heart. The longer you wait, the harder it is to transition. I felt hopeless, that I was just going to look like a man in drag for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>On my 16th birthday, when I didn&#x2019;t receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep.</p></blockquote>

<p>Later, she detailed her emotional turmoil.</p>
<blockquote><p>After a summer of having almost no friends plus the weight of having to think about college, save money for moving out, keep my grades up, go to church each week and feel like shit because everyone there is against everything I live for, I have decided I&#x2019;ve had enough. I&#x2019;m never going to transition successfully, even when I move out. I&#x2019;m never going to be happy with the way I look or sound. I&#x2019;m never going to have enough friends to satisfy me. I&#x2019;m never going to have enough love to satisfy me. I&#x2019;m never going to find a man who loves me. I&#x2019;m never going to be happy.</p>

That&#x2019;s the gist of it, that&#x2019;s why I feel like killing myself. Sorry if that&#x2019;s not a good enough reason for you, it&#x2019;s good enough for me.</p>
<p>As for my will, I want 100% of the things that I legally own to be sold and the money (plus my money in the bank) to be given to trans civil rights movements and support groups, I don&#x2019;t give a shit which one. The only way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren&#x2019;t treated the way I was, they&#x2019;re treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights. Gender needs to be taught about in schools, the earlier the better. My death needs to mean something. My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year.</p>
<p>I want someone to look at that number and say &#x201C;that&#x2019;s fucked up&#x201D; and fix it. Fix society. Please.</p></blockquote>

<p>Updated: Thursday, Jan. 1, 2015, 1:00 p.m. EST</p>
<p>UNION TOWNSHIP, <a href=""http://www.lgbtqnation.com/tag/ohio/"">Ohio</a> &#x2014; A 17-year-old <a href=""http://www.lgbtqnation.com/tag/transgender"">transgender</a> teen was struck and killed by a passing semi trailer on an Ohio interstate on Sunday, and a previously written <a href=""http://www.lgbtqnation.com/tag/suicide/"">suicide</a> note later appeared on the teen&#x2019;s Tumblr blog through scheduled publishing.</p>
<p>Leelah Alcorn was in the roadway when she was struck, and is believed to have walked 3-4 miles from her parents house in nearby Kings Mill, Ohio.</p>
<p>Police say she died at 2:20 a.m. Sunday.</p>
<p>The incident is being investigated by the Ohio State Highway Patrol, but hours after Leelah&#x2019;s death <a href=""http://www.lgbtqnation.com/2014/12/transgender-teen-struck-and-killed-on-ohio-interstate-in-apparent-suicide/2/"">a suicide note</a> appeared on her Tumblr blog.</p>
<p>In the note, Leelah said she identified as a transgender female from age 14, when she first became aware of the term, having felt &#x201C;like a girl trapped in a boy&#x2019;s body&#x201D; since she was four. </p>
<p>Article continues below</p>
Leelah said she subsequently came out online, and turned primarily towards the <a href=""http://www.lgbtqnation.com/tag/internet/"">internet</a> for friendship. She said she attempted to convince her parents that she had to medically transition, but claims she instead received therapy and &#x201C;biased&#x201D; counseling from Christian therapists:
<p>Leelah also describes <a href=""http://www.lgbtqnation.com/tag/coming-out/"">coming out</a> as gay at age 16, hoping it would be a stepping stone to coming out as transgender at a later date. She wrote that she was instead taken out of school by her parents and cut off from the outside world for five months as her parents denied her access to her laptop, social media and phone. </p>
<p>She described this as a contributing factor towards her suicide. <a href=""http://www.lgbtqnation.com/2014/12/transgender-teen-struck-and-killed-on-ohio-interstate-in-apparent-suicide/2/"">Read Leelah&#x2019;s suicide note</a> &#x2192;</p> </div>",www.lgbtqnation.com,,269

                                <p>Transgender teen <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2891267/Transgender-teenager-leaves-heartbreaking-suicide-note-blaming-Christian-parents-walking-tractor-trailer-highway.html"">Leelah Alcorn</a> killed herself by jumping in front of a semi during the early hours on Sunday morning in Warren County, along highway I-71. The 17-year-old Ohio teen left a suicide note blaming her Christian parents for her death. Leelah was upset that her parents would not allow her to get the gender transitioning surgery she desired.</p>
<p>Alcorn left a suicide note on her Tumblr account which has since gone viral. Posting the suicide note, Leelah Alcorn said her parents refused to acknowledge her gender and forbid her from transitioning into a female.</p>
<p>The Leelah Alcorn suicide note begins by stating, &#x201C;If you are reading this, it means that I have committed suicide and obviously failed to delete this post from my queue.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The note posted by the transgender teenager was scheduled to post just several hours after Alcorn committed suicide by walking onto Ohio I-71 in the Kings Mill area and stepping in front of a tractor-trailer.</p>

<p>&#x201C;When I was 14, I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness. After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was,&#x201D; Leelah Acorn&#x2019;s suicide note said. &#x201C;I immediately told my mom and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that is was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn&#x2019;t make mistakes, that I am wrong.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The transgender teen went on to say that her parents would not allow her to transition and began taking her to Christian therapists who allegedly told her that she was &#x201C;selfish and wrong.&#x201D; Alcorn added in the suicide note, &#x201C;I formed a sort of a f**k you attitude towards my parents and came out as gay at school, thinking that maybe if I eased into coming out as trans, it would be less of a shock. Although the reaction from my friends was positive, my parents were pissed. They felt like I was attacking their image, and that I was an embarrassment to them.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Leelah&#x2019;s viral suicide note goes on to state, &#x201C;They wanted me to be their prefect little straight Christian boy, and that&#x2019;s obviously not what I wanted. On my 16th birthday, when I didn&#x2019;t receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep.&#x201D;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m never going to be happy. Either I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman, who hates herself.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
<p>Another excerpt from the suicide letter reads, &#x201C;So they took me out of public school, took away my laptop and phone, and forbid me of getting on any sort of social media, completely isolating me from my friends. This was probably the part of my life when I was the most depressed, and I&#x2019;m surprised I didn&#x2019;t kill myself. I was completely alone for five months. No friends, no support, no love. Just my parent&#x2019;s disappointment and the cruelty of loneliness. At the end of the school year, my parents finally came around and gave me my phone and let me back on social media. I was excited, I finally had my friends back. They were extremely excited to see me and talk to me, but only at first. Eventually, they realized they didn&#x2019;t actually give a sh*t about me, and I felt even lonelier than I did before. The only friends I thought I had only liked me because they saw me five times a week.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The remainder of Leelah&#x2019;s suicide letter states, &#x201C;After a summer of having almost no friends plus the weight of having to think about college, save money for moving out, keep my grades up, go to church each week and feel like sh*t because everyone there is against everything I live for, I have decided I&#x2019;ve had enough. I&#x2019;m never going to transition successfully, even when I move out. I&#x2019;m never going to be happy with the way I look or sound. I&#x2019;m never going to have enough friends to satisfy me. I&#x2019;m never going to have enough love to satisfy me. I&#x2019;m never going to find a man who loves me. I&#x2019;m never going to be happy. There&#x2019;s no way out. I&#x2019;m sad enough already, I don&#x2019;t need my life to get any worse. People say &#x2018;it gets better&#x2019; but that isn&#x2019;t true in my case. It gets worse. Each day I get worse.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s the gist of it, that&#x2019;s why I feel like killing myself. Sorry, if that&#x2019;s not a good enough reason for you, it&#x2019;s good enough for me. As for my will, I want 100 percent of the things that I legally own to be sold and the money (plus my money in the bank) to be given to trans civil rights movements and support groups, I don&#x2019;t give a sh*t which one. The only way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren&#x2019;t treated the way I was, they&#x2019;re treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights. Gender needs to be taught about in schools, the earlier, the better. My death needs to mean something. My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year. I want someone to look at that number and say &#x201C;that&#x2019;s f***ed up&#x201D; and fix it. Fix society. Please.</p>

However, this particular incident has unique circumstances that brought to light an issue that has spawned worldwide discussion.&#xA0;</i><p>The mother of a Warren County teenager whose suicide sparked an international transgender discussion told CNN this week the family loved Joshua Alcorn unconditionally.</p><p>&quot;We don&apos;t support that, religiously,&quot; Carla Alcorn told CNN Wednesday, &quot;But we told him that we loved him unconditionally. We loved him no matter what. I loved my son. People need to know that I loved him. He was a good kid, a good boy.&quot;</p><p>The 17-year-old died on Interstate 71 Sunday after being struck by a truck in the southbound lanes near the South Lebanon exit. Alcorn was pronounced dead at the scene.Final results will be released once toxicology results are back, but the Warren County Coroner&apos;s Office considers it a likely suicide.<p>The teen, who identifies as Leelah, walked three or four miles from home onto the highway after reportedly posting an online suicide note blaming her parents for not accepting her choice and details living as a transgender person.</p></p><p>&#x201C;I feel like a girl trapped in a boy&apos;s body, and I&apos;ve felt that way ever since I was 4,&#x201D; the post reads.</p><p>Leelah&apos;s death has sparked an emotional worldwide debate across social media. The hashtag #RealLifeTransAdult began trending on Facebook and Twitter as transgender adults shared their experience with teens, telling them not to give up and that things will get better.&#xA0;</p>&quot;If you&apos;re a trans teen and think there&apos;s no future, I came out at 36 and I never thought my life could be this great #RealLiveTransAdult&quot; one tweet read from @HLeeHurley.<p>In her interview with CNN, Carla Alcorn referred to her child as a son and said he was depressed and given medication by counselors and a psychiatrist.</p><p>She said there has not been a service for Alcorn because people have threatened to protest. She also told CNN her child came to her only once to say he was a transgender and she never heard the name Leelah until she read the suicide note.</p><p>&quot;He never said that name before,&quot; she told CNN.</p><p>&quot;It is time for all of us regardless of our sexual orientation to stand together to remember someone we lost,&quot; wrote Adam Hoover from Support Marriage Equality in Ohio in a Facebook posting announcing the vigil. &quot;Every time I see someone claim their life, I get upset. Acceptance should not be something granted to few. Acceptance should be given to everyone, we are a diverse world of people.&quot;&#xA0;Josh Wagoner with the local chapter of the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network says several young people struggle with this same issue.&quot;When I heard about Leelah I was, and am, really troubled that someone so close to us felt so alone,&quot; he said. &quot;A person who is trans is always experiencing a difference around, not just their orientation, who they love, who they&apos;re attracted to, but also who they are.&quot;&quot;It&apos;s horrible that people think that that&apos;s the only option they have,&quot; added Nicki Sullivan.Nicki Sullivan knows all too well what it&apos;s like to raise a transgender child. Earlier this year, amid controversy, Sullivan made public her 7 year olds identity is now female, despite being born male. She says her daughter Ella is happier now, but it still presents challenges.&quot;It&apos;s always emotional though because she comes home from school crying, comes home from school excited. You never know I guess what exactly is going to happen that day,&quot; said Sullivan.The Greater Cincinnati Youth Group meets every week to engage young people struggling with these same issues and Wagoner encourages anyone who needs help to start here.&quot;When middle school age and high school age come to that they really get the sense that there are people who are a lot like them,&quot; said Wagoner.There are local and national resources for anyone struggling with suicidal thoughts or depression:&#xA0;<p><a href=""http://www.thetrevorproject.org/"">Trevor&apos;s Project</a>: 1-866-488-7386</p><p><a href=""http://glsen.org/chapters/cincinnati"">GLSEN Greater Cincinnati Youth Group</a>: 866-934-9119</p><p><a href=""http://transwellness.org/"">Heartland Trans Wellness</a>: 513-549-4447</p><p><i>Copyright 2015 WXIX.

      </div><div class=""article-content""><p>From Laverne Cox&apos;s historic Emmy nomination and revolutionary&#xA0;<em>Time&#xA0;</em>magazine cover, to Laura Jane Grace and Against Me!&apos;s triumphant&#xA0;<em><a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/transgender-dysphoria-blues-20140121"">Transgender Dysphoria Blues</a>, </em>2014 has been a <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/11-ways-2014-was-the-biggest-year-in-transgender-history-20141223"">groundbreaking, glass ceiling-shattering year for the transgender community</a>. But the opposition, prejudice and ignorance the&#xA0;trans community continues to face&#xA0;was highlighted once again in a tragic note left by a 17-year-old trans teen, Leelah Alcorn, who committed suicide over the weekend.</p>

<p>As <a href=""http://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/warren-county/joshua-alcorn-kings-mill-teen-killed-on-i-71-remembered-as-sweet-talented"">WCPO Cincinnati</a>&#xA0;reports, the Kings Mill, Ohio teen, who was born a boy named Joshua, was hit by a tractor trailer at 2:20 a.m. as she walked along the southbound lanes of I-71. Alcorn had pre-scheduled a <a href=""http://lazerprincess.tumblr.com/post/106447705738/suicide-note"">suicide note</a>&#xA0;to appear on her Tumblr, <a href=""http://lazerprincess.tumblr.com/post/106547704517/sorry"">followed by a note</a>&#xA0;apologizing to various people (though not her&#xA0;parents, to whom she said: &quot;Fuck you. You can&apos;t just control other people like that. That&apos;s messed up&quot;).</p>
<p>According to the&#xA0;<em><a href=""http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2014/12/30/transgender-teen-death-needs-mean-something/21044407/"">Cincinnati Enquirer</a></em>, an investigation into the accident is still pending, though no charges have been filed; an autopsy is also underway, though that will take several weeks. Though Alcorn&apos;s family declined to comment, they released a statement via the Kings Local School District requesting privacy and stating, &quot;Joshua Alcorn was a sweet, talented, tender-hearted 17-year-old.&quot;</p>
<p>As Alcorn explained in her suicide note, she felt &quot;like a girl trapped in a boy&apos;s body&quot; ever since age four. After a decade of doing her best to fit in and &quot;do traditionally &apos;boyish&apos; things,&quot; Alcorn wrote, &quot;I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness. After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was. I immediately told my mom, and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that it was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn&#x2019;t make mistakes, that I am wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>Alcorn (pictured above in photos posted on <a href=""http://www.lazerprincess.tumblr.com/"">lazerprincess.tumblr.com</a>) detailed her troubling relationship with her conservative Christian parents, who sent her to Christian therapists&#xA0;unable to properly help her sort through her depression, and refused to give her consent to begin transitioning when she turned 16.&#xA0;In her note, Alcorn urged parents not to say the kind of things Alcorn claims her own did: &quot;Even if you are Christian or are against transgender people, don&#x2019;t ever say that to someone, especially your kid. That won&#x2019;t do anything but make them hate them self. That&#x2019;s exactly what it did to me.&quot;</p>

<p>Alcorn&apos;s parents eventually took her out of school (she came out as gay to her classmates, thinking it would be easier than to come out as trans), and banned her from social media, which left her without any sort of support group for five months.</p>
<p>But even after the ban was lifted,&#xA0;she continued to feel alienated and depressed. Many of her friends had ditched her, and she writes that the&#xA0;stresses of school work, applying for colleges, going to church and saving money to move out had become&#xA0;too heavy.&#xA0;Though her 18th birthday was approaching, Alcorn felt she would never have a successful transition and would spend the rest of her life&#xA0;lonely, dissatisfied&#xA0;with her body and self and unloved.</p>
<p>&quot;Either I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself,&quot; wrote Alcorn. &quot;There&#x2019;s no winning. There&#x2019;s no way out.&#xA0;I&apos;m sad enough already, I don&apos;t need my life to get any worse. People say &apos;it gets better&apos; but that isn&apos;t true in my case. It gets worse. Each day I get worse.&quot;</p>
<p>Alcorn wrote that&#xA0;she wanted 100 percent of the things she legally owned to be sold, and for all the money, plus her&#xA0;bank assets, to be given to trans civil rights movements and support groups.</p>
<p>&quot;The only way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren&#x2019;t treated the way I was. They&#x2019;re treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights. Gender needs to be taught about in schools, the earlier the better. My death needs to mean something. My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year. I want someone to look at that number and say, &apos;That&#x2019;s fucked up&apos; and fix it. Fix society. Please.&quot; She signed the note, &quot;(Leelah) <span>Josh</span> Alcorn.&quot;</p>

The <a href=""http://lazerprincess.tumblr.com/post/106447705738/suicide-note"">Tumblr post</a> that Leelah scheduled for after her time of death, constituting her suicide note and final wishes, is gut-wrenching. </p> <p>On the page where she describes herself as &quot;the transgender queen of hell &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3,&quot; Leelah left a post detailing her coming out to her Christian parents as transgender and their negative reaction. She eventually was pulled out of school and forbidden from using social media after coming out to her peers as gay. Even when her parents allowed her back on social media, Leelah says she felt lonely and like she had no friends. </p> <p>&quot;I have decided I&#x2019;ve had enough,&quot; she wrote in the post. &quot;I&#x2019;m never going to transition successfully, even when I move out. I&#x2019;m never going to be happy with the way I look or sound. I&#x2019;m never going to have enough friends to satisfy me. I&#x2019;m never going to have enough love to satisfy me. I&#x2019;m never going to find a man who loves me. I&#x2019;m never going to be happy. Either I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself. There&#x2019;s no winning. There&#x2019;s no way out. I&#x2019;m sad enough already, I don&#x2019;t need my life to get any worse. People say &apos;it gets better&apos; but that isn&#x2019;t true in my case. It gets worse. Each day I get worse.&quot;</p> <p>She requested that her possessions be sold and the proceeds, as well as the contents of her bank account, be donated to &quot;trans civil rights movements and support groups.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;My death needs to mean something,&quot; she wrote. &quot;My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year. I want someone to look at that number and say &apos;that&#x2019;s f--ked up&apos; and fix it. Fix society. Please.&quot;</p> <p>In a <a href=""http://lazerprincess.tumblr.com/post/106547704517/sorry"">separate post</a> scheduled immediately after her suicide note and entitled &quot;Sorry,&quot; Leelah apologizes to her siblings and various friends. &quot;Please don&apos;t be sad,&quot; she writes to her younger sister. </p> <p>Her words for her parents, however, were straightforward: &quot;Mom and Dad: F--k you. You can&#x2019;t just control other people like that. That&#x2019;s messed up.&quot;</p> <p>Considering her mother&apos;s Facebook post, announcing that her &quot;sweet 16 year old son, Joshua Ryan Alcorn went home to heaven this morning&quot; after an &quot;early morning walk,&quot; Leelah&apos;s wishes don&apos;t appear to have been taken to heart yet. </p> <div class=""photo"" id=""29d4adb4244379dc2a0606fee2c75924""><img class=""lazyload"" src=""http://imagesmtv-a.akamaihd.net/uri/mgid:file:http:shared:mtv.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/alcornfacebook-1419960378.png?quality=.8&amp;height=274.5796241345203&amp;width=800""></div><p>(Note: All news reports, as well as Leelah&apos;s Tumblr, list her age as 17.)</p> <p>For those still wishing to refer to Leelah as male, she also had a final message in her &quot;Sorry&quot; Tumblr post. </p> <p>&quot;Also, anyone who says something like &apos;I wish I got to know him better&apos; or &apos;I wish I treated him better&apos; gets a punch in the nose.&quot;</p> <p><b>If you are transgender and thinking about suicide, or know someone who is, please contact the <a href=""http://www.translifeline.org/"">Trans Lifeline</a> at (877) 565-8860.</b></p> <p>If you&apos;re struggling with issues of identity, head to <a href=""http://www.halfofus.com/condition/suicide/"">Half of Us</a>.</p> <p>To learn more about being transgender, check out <a href=""http://www.glaad.org/"">GLAAD</a> and <a href=""http://www.lookdifferent.org/topics/22-transgender-rights"">Look Different</a>.</p> <aside class=""sidebar ad ""> </aside> </section>",www.mtv.com,,1

The life I would&#x2019;ve lived isn&#x2019;t worth living in&#x2026; because I&#x2019;m transgender. I could go into detail explaining why I feel that way, but this note is probably going to be lengthy enough as it is. To put it simply, I feel like a girl trapped in a boy&#x2019;s body, and I&#x2019;ve felt that way ever since I was 4. I never knew there was a word for that feeling, nor was it possible for a boy to become a girl, so I never told anyone and I just continued to do traditionally &#x201C;boyish&#x201D; things to try to fit in.</span></font></p><p class=""mol-para-with-font""><font><span class=""mol-style-italic"">When I was 14, I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness. After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was. I immediately told my mom, and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that it was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn&#x2019;t make mistakes, that I am wrong. If you are reading this, parents, please don&#x2019;t tell this to your kids. Even if you are Christian or are against transgender people don&#x2019;t ever say that to someone, especially your kid. That won&#x2019;t do anything but make them hate them self. That&#x2019;s exactly what it did to me.</span></font></p><p class=""mol-para-with-font""><font><span class=""mol-style-italic"">My mom started taking me to a therapist, but would only take me to christian therapists, (who were all very biased) so I never actually got the therapy I needed to cure me of my depression. I only got more christians telling me that I was selfish and wrong and that I should look to God for help.</span></font></p><p class=""mol-para-with-font""><font><span class=""mol-style-italic"">When I was 16 I realized that my parents would never come around, and that I would have to wait until I was 18 to start any sort of transitioning treatment, which absolutely broke my heart. The longer you wait, the harder it is to transition. I felt hopeless, that I was just going to look like a man in drag for the rest of my life. On my 16th birthday, when I didn&#x2019;t receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep.</span></font></p><p class=""mol-para-with-font""><font><span class=""mol-style-italic"">I formed a sort of a &#x201C;f*** you&#x201D; attitude towards my parents and came out as gay at school, thinking that maybe if I eased into coming out as trans it would be less of a shock. Although the reaction from my friends was positive, my parents were pissed. They felt like I was attacking their image, and that I was an embarrassment to them. They wanted me to be their perfect little straight christian boy, and that&#x2019;s obviously not what I wanted.</span></font></p><p class=""mol-para-with-font""><font><span class=""mol-style-italic"">So they took me out of public school, took away my laptop and phone, and forbid me of getting on any sort of social media, completely isolating me from my friends. This was probably the part of my life when I was the most depressed, and I&#x2019;m surprised I didn&#x2019;t kill myself. I was completely alone for 5 months. No friends, no support, no love. Just my parent&#x2019;s disappointment and the cruelty of loneliness.</span></font></p><p class=""mol-para-with-font""><font><span class=""mol-style-italic"">At the end of the school year, my parents finally came around and gave me my phone and let me back on social media. I was excited, I finally had my friends back. They were extremely excited to see me and talk to me, but only at first. Eventually they realized they didn&#x2019;t actually give a s**t about me, and I felt even lonelier than I did before. The only friends I thought I had only liked me because they saw me five times a week.</span></font></p><p class=""mol-para-with-font""><font><span class=""mol-style-italic"">After a summer of having almost no friends plus the weight of having to think about college, save money for moving out, keep my grades up, go to church each week and feel like s**t because everyone there is against everything I live for, I have decided I&#x2019;ve had enough. I&#x2019;m never going to transition successfully, even when I move out. I&#x2019;m never going to be happy with the way I look or sound. I&#x2019;m never going to have enough friends to satisfy me. I&#x2019;m never going to have enough love to satisfy me. I&#x2019;m never going to find a man who loves me. I&#x2019;m never going to be happy. Either I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself. There&#x2019;s no winning. There&#x2019;s no way out. I&#x2019;m sad enough already, I don&#x2019;t need my life to get any worse. People say &#x201C;it gets better&#x201D; but that isn&#x2019;t true in my case. It gets worse. Each day I get worse.</span></font></p><p class=""mol-para-with-font""><font><span class=""mol-style-italic"">That&#x2019;s the gist of it, that&#x2019;s why I feel like killing myself. Sorry if that&#x2019;s not a good enough reason for you, it&#x2019;s good enough for me. As for my will, I want 100% of the things that I legally own to be sold and the money (plus my money in the bank) to be given to trans civil rights movements and support groups, I don&#x2019;t give a s**t which one. The only way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren&#x2019;t treated the way I was, they&#x2019;re treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights. Gender needs to be taught about in schools, the earlier the better. My death needs to mean something. My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year. I want someone to look at that number and say &#x201C;that&#x2019;s f***ed up&#x201D; and fix it. Fix society.

                                <p>Anna Wintour reportedly has a major rat infestation at her <em>Vogue</em> office in New York City.</p>
<p>According to <a href=""http://radaronline.com/exclusives/2014/11/anna-wintour-vogue-rat-infestation/""><em>Radar Online</em></a>, some of the dirtiest rats have decided to move into Anna&#x2019;s new office for herself and <em>Vogue</em> staffers at the Freedom Tower.</p>
<p>Insiders claim that rodents invaded the beloved accessories closet, leaving an abundance of rat droppings all over their pricey couture, computers, and desks. Further reports claim that the decision to put Kanye West and Kim Kardashian on the cover of <em>Vogue</em> magazine may have something to do with the infestation.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#x201C;The office is over-run and the <em>Vogue</em> staff is secretly whispering that the rats could be cosmic payback for Anna&#x2019;s decision to put Kim Kardashian and Kanye West on the cover. There was so much backlash, and now this!&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
<p>As previously reported by the <em>Inquisitr</em>, critics were <a href=""http://www.inquisitr.com/1183091/anna-wintour-says-kim-kardashian-and-kanye-west-define-the-culture-really/"">not very happy</a> with Anna Wintour and the <em>Vogue</em> staff making the &#x201C;disgusting&#x201D; decision to place the reality starlet and her husband on the cover. The couple was photographed for the April 2014 cover by Anne Leibovitz.</p>
<p><em>Vogue</em> and Cond&#xE9; Nast relocated from Times Square to One World Trade Center. However, the rat infestation has not made the <em>Vogue</em> relocation as smooth as they would have liked &#x2013; especially since reports claim that the rats are only located on the <em>Vogue</em> floors of the building.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#x201C;There were droppings all over the floor, and some of the shoe boxes had been chewed into&#x2026; The rats appear to have gotten in via the venting, which was being worked on even as staffers were moving in. Walls were being moved to accommodate last-minute design changes&#x2026;and it&#x2019;s assumed this is how the rats got in.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
<p>Even though Anna Wintour usually allows employees to eat and drink inside of the office, reports claim that a strict policy restricting food and drinks has been issued and enforced until the infestation problem is resolved.</p>
<p><em><a href=""http://gawker.com/vogue-s-shiny-new-office-has-a-big-rat-problem-1661685600"">Gawker</a>,</em> the media outlet that initially broke the story, reports that Anna Wintour refuses to even enter her office until it is in pristine condition and completely freed of its rat infestation.</p>
<p>Anna Wintour has made headlines recently by expressing how she felt about the Kim Kardashian and Kanye West cover shoot experience. <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/20/anna-wintour-kimye-cover_n_6191708.html""><em>Huffington Post</em></a> reports that Wintour even hopes that &#x201C;another Kim Kardashian comes along this year.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In her own words, Anna Wintour did not feel that the cover photo was &#x201C;disgusting&#x201D; at all. On the contrary, she believes that it was touching and charming.</p>

According to insiders, the pesky rodents have invaded the infamous accessories closet and made their presence known by leaving droppings on desks, computers, and pricey couture!</p>
<p>&#x201C;The office is over-run and the <em>Vogue</em> staff is secretly whispering that the rats could be <a href=""http://radaronline.com/exclusives/2014/11/kimye-vogue-cover-kim-kardashian-kanye-west-anna-wintour/"">cosmic payback</a> for Anna&#x2019;s decision to put <a href=""http://radaronline.com/category/tags/Kim-Kardashian/"">Kim Kardashian</a> and <a href=""http://radaronline.com/category/tags/Kanye-West/"">Kanye West</a> on the cover,&#x201D; a <em>Vogue</em> staffer revealed. &#x201C;There was so much backlash, and now this!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Cond&#xE9; Nast and <em>Vogue</em> recently decamped from Times Square to the new digs at One World Trade Center, and the move has not gone off without a hitch.</p> <p><a href=""http://radaronline.com/photos/kim-kardashian-paper-magazine-winter-issue-jean-paul-goude-keeping-up-with-the-kardashians-paris-fashion-week/"">PHOTOS: From Vogue To Vagina &#x2013; Kim Kardashian Poses Nude For Paper Magazine&#x2019;s 2014 Winter Issue &#x2013; See The NSFW Photos!</a></p>
<p><em>Vogue</em> occupies floors 25 and 26, and &#x201C;this is where the rats have taken up residence,&#x201D; a source said. &#x201C;Cond&#xE9; Nast has floors 20 through 44, but the rats are confined to the<em> Vogue</em> floors only. Hey, New York City rats are smart: they know <a href=""http://radaronline.com/exclusives/2014/05/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-vogue-cover-sales-lower-than-expected/"">where the good stuff is</a>!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;The famed accessories closet, which was being put together with the designer wares from the old office, was taking shape when the rats got into it,&#x201D; the source revealed. &#x201C;There were droppings all over the floor, and some of the shoe boxes had&#xA0;been chewed into.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;The rats appear to have gotten in via the venting, which was being worked on even as staffers were moving in,&#x201D; the source explained. &#x201C;Walls were being moved to accommodate <a href=""http://radaronline.com/videos/james-franco-seth-rogen-mock-kim-kardashian-kanye-west-vogue-cover/"">last-minute design changes</a> by Anna and Cond&#xE9; Nast, and it&#x2019;s assumed this is how the rats got in.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Now, the source said, &#x201C;A strict no food or drinks policy at people&#x2019;s work stations has been issued until the infestation is gone.&#x201D; (The source said pin-thin Wintour does, in fact, normally allow staffers to eat in the office.)</p>
<p>But meanwhile, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s very unnerving to come to work in the morning, and find rat droppings on computers, and desks!&#x201D; the source said. &#x201C;<a href=""http://radaronline.com/exclusives/2014/03/anna-wintour-explains-kim-kardashian-kanye-west-vogue-cover/"">Anna isn&#x2019;t amused</a> and top pest control experts have been hired to get the problem dealt with quickly.&#x201D;</p>
<p><a href=""http://gawker.com/vogue-s-shiny-new-office-has-a-big-rat-problem-1661685600""><em>Gawker</em></a>, which broke the story, says Wintour has told assistants that her pristine office must be rat-free before she enters.</p>

<p>New York City rats are notorious for being able to survive floods, snow storms, and any other force of nature&#x2026;.have they finally met their match in Anna?&#x201D;</p>

Per the report, it sounds like the staffers may be victims of their own highfalutin-design preferences; due to architectural changes requested by Anna Wintour and Cond&#xE9; Nast prior to the move-in date, the little suckers may have gotten in through the vents.</p>

<p>Rats still roam at <a href=""http://pagesix.com/tag/vogue-magazine/"">Vogue</a>!</p>
<p>We&#x2019;re told by several insiders that staffers at the fashion bible are <a href=""http://pagesix.com/2014/11/21/anna-wintour-refuses-to-work-at-wtc-due-to-rats/"">still seeing rodents at Cond&#xE9; Nast&#x2019;s new 1 WTC digs</a>, which are still under construction.</p>
<p>A source told us editors spotted at least one critter this week under a desk, and immediately notified <a href=""http://pagesix.com/tag/anna-wintour/"">Anna Wintour</a>.</p>
<p>&#x201C;They were petrified, and told Anna, &#x2018;We found rats under our desk,&#x2019;&#x201D; a source claims. &#x201C;One said, &#x2018;There&#x2019;s a rat on top of my desk.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p>
<p>But Wintour replied, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t want to hear about it,&#x201D; according to our source.&#xA0;A different source also told us there&#x2019;s &#x201C;still a rat problem&#x201D; at the office.</p>
<p>But a Vogue insider insisted there&#x2019;s no rat issue and Wintour did not dismiss employees&#x2019; concerns. &#x201C;That conversation never happened,&#x201D; the source sniffed.</p>
<p>Vogue was one of the first glossy titles to move into Cond&#xE9;&#x2019;s new downtown headquarters, but the rodents seemed to have beaten Wintour and her team to the tower&#x2019;s 25th and 26th floors.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.people.com/article/vogue-new-office-rat-infestation-new-york-anna-wintour-one-world-trade-center"">An insider quoted in People magazine in November said</a>, &#x201C;The girls that work there see the droppings everywhere. It&#x2019;s nasty.&#x201D; Reports say the magazines have issued an edict not to eat at desks to help starve out any Rodentia.</p>

<p>In case you missed it,<em><strong> Vogue </strong></em>Magazine, one of the most glamorous institutions in the country has been dealing with the least glamorous issue ever: a rat infestation.</p>
<p>The rodents have literally been living it up in <a href=""http://www.thegloss.com/2014/11/17/fashion/amy-adams-vogue-cover-photo-december-2014-sexy/""><em>Vogue</em>&#x2019;s</a> new luxurious digs at <strong>1 World Trade Center</strong> in New York City. <a href=""http://radaronline.com/exclusives/2014/11/anna-wintour-vogue-rat-infestation/?utm_source=skimlinks.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=skimlinks.com"">Reportedly</a>, the rats took up residence in <a href=""http://www.thegloss.com/2014/11/19/culture/anna-wintour-kim-kardashian-kanye-west-not-tasteful-vogue-magazine-cover/""><strong>Anna Wintour&#x2019;s</strong></a> office and have moved into the magazine&#x2019;s world famous accessories closet.</p>
<p><a href=""http://gawker.com/vogue-s-rat-infestation-disturbing-new-details-1663367019""><em>Gawker</em></a> reported that the critters have made <em>Vogue&#x2019;s</em> infamous editor-in-chief scared to enter her office without taking precautions first.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#x201C;The infestation is so acute, one source said, that the fashion title&#x2019;s editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour, recently issued a standing order: Staffers must ensure that her personal office is rat-free before she enters it&#x2026;&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
<p>A source told <a href=""http://www.people.com/article/vogue-new-office-rat-infestation-new-york-anna-wintour-one-world-trade-center""><em>People </em></a>that: &#x201C;the girls that work there see the droppings everywhere. It&#x2019;s nasty.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The rats have also reportedly eaten holes into shoe boxes and left droppings on the floor of the accessories closet. It&#x2019;s believed that <em>Vogue</em>&#x2019;s newest office mates made their way into the office through the ventilation system.</p>

<p>Call me petty, but after this headline made me gag, it also made me laugh hysterically. I know that vermin infestations are no laughing matter but there are just too many hilarious visuals that this headline conjures up.</p>
<p>I just keep picturing rats happily nibbling on <strong>Michael Kors</strong> dresses as if they&#x2019;re camembert cheese. I also can&#x2019;t get the image of Anna Wintour frantically directing Vogue staffers who are on their hands and knees to verify that her office is rat-free. It seems like something from an episode of <em>Ugly Betty</em> or a scene from the sequel to <em>The Devil Wears Prada</em> (which I would totally watch by the way).</p>

<p>If you&#x2019;re worried about how Anna will deal with this crisis, never fear. Apparently Ms. Wintour is calling in the <em>Olivia Pope</em> of rat exterminators.</p>

<p>I guess the situation is getting handled. In the meantime, I&#x2019;ll just keep picturing rats chasing models around the halls of&#xA0;<em>Vogue&#x2019;</em>s new offices.</p> </section>",www.thegloss.com,,1

				<p>Vermin? They&#x2019;re totally in <em>Vogue</em>.  </p>
<p>According to staffers who work at the storied fashion bible, helmed by <a href=""http://www.people.com/article/AnnaWintour,00.html"">Anna Wintour</a>, the brand-new <em>Vogue</em> offices at the Freedom Tower in downtown New York City are full of furry little friends &#x2013; and no one thinks it&#x2019;s chic at all.   </p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s true,&#x201D; an insider confirms to PEOPLE. &#x201C;The girls that work there see the droppings everywhere. It&#x2019;s nasty.&#x201D;  </p>
<p>According to a report on <a href=""http://gawker.com/vogue-s-shiny-new-office-has-a-big-rat-problem-1661685600"">Gawker</a>, <a href=""http://www.people.com/article/oscar-de-la-renta-funeral-manhattan"">Wintour</a>, who recently made headlines for calling the magazine&#x2019;s April cover stars <a href=""http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20800166,00.html"">Kim Kardashian and Kanye West</a> not &#x201C;deeply tasteful,&#x201D; is apparently refusing to enter her personal office unless it&#x2019;s rat-free.   </p>
<p>However, beyond the rodent problem, insiders say another issue the fashionistas are having is with the office&#x2019;s location itself &#x2013; next to the former <a href=""http://www.people.com/article/national-september-11th-museum-memorial-opening-obama"">World Trade Center</a> towers.   </p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s weird down there. You&#x2019;re always reminded of 9/11,&#x201D; a source says. Another adds, &#x201C;It just has creepy vibes.&#x201D;  </p>

	&quot;A bunch ate through the ceiling of a sports editor&apos;s office and crawled all over his desk and left poops on his keyboard,&quot; said a different source. &quot;They ate through his rug to fit under his door.&quot;</p>   
<p>
	We&apos;re told that Conde has sent a memo to their staff in the building telling them that &quot;they cannot eat at their desks&quot; and that a complaint to the city&apos;s health department is next on the agenda.</p>         
<p>
	When we bumped into Carter outside the tower, where the publishing house set up shop in November, we asked him if the little beasts are disgusting as we&apos;ve heard. &quot;They&apos;re rats!&quot; laughed the legendary editor, &quot;What do you think?&quot;</p>   
<br>

	The Durst Organization, which manages One World Trade Center for the Port Authority, declined to comment.</p>
<p>
	Reps for Conde Nast did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
